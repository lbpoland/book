Chapter 17 — Life and Abundance

The night after the waters withdrew was more a hush than a darkness. The firmament breathed, the waters hummed in their basins, and the hosts slept with a sense of expectancy that vibrated in their bones. Chroniel’s threads, hung like delicate strings across the valley, thrummed at a deeper, steadier rhythm, signalling a moment of gathering, of unveiling. Kairosiel walked among them, touching each thread, listening for the door that would open with the dawn. No one said much; words felt heavy with potential. Somewhere, in the deep places of the world, a rumble stirred.

When morning came — though again no sun yet marked morning — the light shifted in quality. It was thicker, warmer. Its hue hinted at soil and stone. The hosts gathered around the sea they had watched form, its surface calm and reflective as a mirror. Gabriel noticed that the mist clinging to their feathers held a scent now: earthy, like rain that has struck parched ground. Raphael filled his lungs with it and felt soothed.

The Source stood at the edge of the waters. His presence encompassed the sea and the sky and the very floor of the valley. He smiled, and the smile was reflected on the still water. “We will gather the waters below into one place,” He said, “so that dry land may appear. The land will be foundation. It will bear seed and fruit. It will display patterns. It will be abundant.”

He lifted His hand, and His voice rolled over the sea like thunder and like a father calling children inside. “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place,” He said, “and let the dry land appear.”

The waters shuddered and obeyed. Great currents moved with purpose. The sea receded from the valley, rolling back as though bowing, revealing ground that had never before touched light. Rivers formed and found their beds. Lakes nestled into depressions. Streams wound like ribbons across the widening plain. The hosts watched as mountains rose slowly from the deep, their peaks glistening, as hills rolled out like the backs of resting creatures. Valleys emerged, lush and dark even without vegetation. The dry land was not barren; its soil was rich, black and brown and red, streaked with minerals that shimmered when light struck them. Stones of all colours surfaced — emerald green, sapphire blue, deep ruby, bright quartz.

Haniel gasped, his hands pressed to his mouth. “It is like a body waking up,” he whispered. “Bones rising, skin forming.”

Matariel, hovering above, let out a sigh that sounded like a summer breeze. “And now the heavens have a floor to dance upon,” she said.

Epheriel knelt and touched the damp earth, bringing it to his nose. “It smells like promise,” he murmured. “Like something waiting to be filled.” He took a handful of the soil and let it sift through his fingers. It clung and stained them dark. “It clings,” he observed. “It wants to hold. It is unlike water, which moves away. This earth is as hungry as it is hospitable.”

God’s voice called again, rich and resonant. “Let the earth sprout vegetation,” He said, “plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.”

The command went forth like a wave, not a single explosion but an unfolding. At first, a whispering. Small green shoots poked through the soil. Then grasses rose in swaths, softening the starkness of the new land. Mosses carpeted rocks, tender as newborn skin. Herbs of all fragrances unfurled leaves. Their scents rose into the air — basil, mint, lavender, sage — none named yet but known by their essence. Flowers opened in bursts of colour: yellows like the Light of the first day, reds like the glow in Raphael’s wings, blues that mirrored the firmament above. Trees grew from saplings to towering forms in moments, their roots digging deep, their trunks thickening, branches stretching out in praise. On some, buds swelled and burst into fruit: figs and pomegranates, olives and dates, apples and pears. Vines crept along hillsides, heavy with clusters of grapes.

Angels cried out in wonder. Haniel danced among the flowers, his laughter mingling with the buzzing of bees that appeared as if by song. Seraphina’s voice joined with the wind, weaving a melody that rose and fell with the grasses. Raphael plucked a leaf and rolled it between his fingers, releasing oils that calmed his spirit. Gabriel tasted a grape offered by a vine and marveled at its sweetness.

“It is alive,” Michael murmured, awe shading his tone. “Not like us, with will, but alive with purpose. It grows because it is commanded. It yields because it is blessed.”

Uriel studied a pattern of ferns, each frond unfurling in precise spirals. “Pattern,” he whispered. “Order so intricate it might be missed. Each plant carries within it the memory of its future. The seed knows the tree, the leaf knows the branch. It is law embedded in cells.”

Nuriel crouched near a field of wheat, watching as golden heads nodded in the breeze. “Fire will one day transmute this into bread,” he said softly. “Heat will bring fragrance out. Transformation is in its future.”

God called them nearer. “Come,” He said. “See how life comes from command and continues by blessing. Each seed carries within itself the power to produce after its kind. This is generosity. Each tree bears fruit not only for itself but for others. This is hospitality. Today you witness abundance born from My word. It is life, but it does not yet choose. It obeys pattern. Moral choice will come later. For now, learn what blessing looks like without the burden of decision.”

The angels gathered around a large fig tree heavy with fruit. God reached out and touched a branch, and the fruit ripened at once. He handed figs to Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Haniel and the Bright One. “Taste,” He invited. “Understand the sweetness of obedience.”

Michael bit into the fig. It was soft and bursting with juice. He closed his eyes. “It is… generous,” he said. “It gives more than my hands can hold.”

Gabriel tasted and laughed. “It hides treasure in plain sight,” he said, wiping juice from his chin. “Outside, it is ordinary. Inside, it is decadent.”

Raphael nodded. “It heals,” he said. “It satisfies hunger, but it also soothes something deeper. When the man weeps, these fruits will comfort him.”

The Bright One tasted as well. He chewed slowly, expression unreadable. “Sweet,” he said simply. He swallowed and looked around at the abundance. His eyes narrowed slightly as he watched fruit fall to the ground, bruise and rot. “Waste,” he murmured. “Fruit that falls and feeds insects and soil and not us. Inefficient.”

Haniel heard and shook his head. “Nothing is wasted,” he responded, bending to watch ants carry away pieces of an overripe pomegranate. “Even rot feeds life. The seed returns to earth to rise again. Pattern holds value.”

The Bright One said nothing more, but he watched as seeds dispersed in the wind, as birds (newly created sparrows and doves) appeared to pick and scatter, as small creatures burrowed and moved seeds underground. His cohort noted his expression but did not speak.

After the land had been clothed and the angels had tasted, God convened a council on pattern and blessing. They met beneath the shade of a broad oak whose branches spread like arms. Its leaves rustled, whispering secrets that only God could interpret fully. Around the tree’s base, new grasses cushioned the ground. Seraphina wove a garland out of tiny white flowers and placed it at the meeting’s center, symbolising life’s delicacy.

“You have seen abundance,” God began. “Each plant yields according to its kind and fills the earth. This is My blessing. But pattern must be stewarded. Without stewardship, blessing can become scarcity. The man will be called to tend and to keep. He will prune trees and harvest fruit. He will rest the land. You must teach him the rhythms embedded in creation.”

Orifiel stepped forward, the embodiment of seasons. “Will seasons begin now?” he asked, a twinkle of frost and heat in his eyes.

“Not yet,” God answered. “We will mark times and seasons soon when lights appear. For now, learn the daily rhythm of growth. See how dew nourishes in the morning and how dryness in midday strengthens stems. Notice that night (when night exists) will slow growth and morning will quicken it. Pattern is woven into the day, and seasons will magnify it.”

Chroniel listened to the hum of his threads. “I feel pulses within pulses,” he said. “Sequence within growth. Some plants sprout quickly and fade. Others grow slowly and endure. Each has its appointed time. I will record their rhythms.”

Kairosiel added, “And some moments will open as doors. Harvest is a door. There will be a right time to pick fruit. Early plucking will be sour, late plucking will be rot. We must teach the man to sense his kairos within the seasons.”

Saraqael scribbled down these insights, adding a series of curved lines and dots to symbolise cycles. “We should develop a notation for rhythms,” he said to Safriel. “Not just a line of events but a circle to show return.”

Safriel smiled. “We could use spirals,” he suggested. “Life is not a straight path but a turning. Each year will bring the same yet different fruit.”

Lumiel, the illuminator who had learned to paint light, proposed using colours to denote seasons. “Green for spring, yellow for harvest, brown for rest,” he mused. “Our scrolls could teach by hue as well as by word.”

God listened with pleasure. “Your creativity pleases Me,” He said. “Remember that stewardship of pattern begins with listening. Listen to the earth when it sighs. Listen to the seeds when they groan. Listen to the roots when they ache. Do not impose schedules out of convenience.”

Gabriel asked, “What of plants that will harm? Thorns and poisonous herbs? Will there be curses hidden in the ground?”

God shook His head gently. “For now, there is no curse,” He said. “Plants will feed, heal, fragrance, and beautify. Thorns and thistles will come later, when ground is withheld from blessing because of the man’s choice. Poison will be repurposed when the man misuses freedom. But even then, within curse, there will be invitation back to blessing. For now, trust that everything is good. And do not fear death of plants; they will die to feed others and rise again. Death of plants is not like death of spirits. It is renewal.”

Michael bowed his head. “Thank You for clarifying, Lord,” he said. “We will teach with hope.”

After the council, the hosts dispersed to explore the new world of vegetation. Guardians practised walking on hills, learning to balance on uneven ground. Rahab and Oriel experimented with building natural terraces to slow water on slopes, preventing erosion without altering the path of rivers. Matariel floated above wheat fields to watch how rain affected ripening. Healers collected herbs, cataloguing scents and properties. Seraphina listened to the hum of bee wings and discovered that her voice could calm swarms. Haniel tasted every fruit he could find, his laughter ringing through orchards.

Among the explorers were new angels introduced by the abundance. Floriel, whose entire being was infused with petals and fragrance, moved through meadows like a breeze, leaving trails of blossoms in her wake. Her hands glowed with colour, and wherever she touched, flowers sprang. She met Raphael and bowed, her voice like bells. “Healing will be fragrant,” she said, pressing a bloom into his hand. “Smell will recall mercy when sight fails.”

Another new being, Choriel, guardian of soil, rose from the ground with skin the colour of loam. He was broad and slow and carried in his hair bits of moss and pebbles. “I will feel every footstep,” he rumbled. “Every seed will whisper to me. I will teach the man to respect the ground he walks on and the soil he tills. If he abuses it, I will withhold abundance until he repents.”

Thaliel approached Choriel, curiosity softening her earlier alignment with the adversary. “Do you feel the pain of soil when it is dry?” she asked.

Choriel nodded. “It groans,” he said simply. “It is like a stomach growling. Hunger calls for rain. Matariel listens. We work together.”

Thaliel ran her fingers through the dirt, feeling its warmth. “I am learning that mercy does not always intervene,” she admitted. “Dryness has its own song.”

Choriel grinned, soil falling from his beard. “Yes,” he said. “And song is not always gentle. Sometimes it is a roar.”

Nearby, watchers engaged in a new training exercise. Saraqael had designed it to help them record not just events but also textures, scents, and tastes. Tables were laid out with fruits, leaves, barks, and resins. Each watcher had tools: quills, ink, wax tablets, cloth strips, fragrant oils, pigment powders. Remiel was there, leading the younger watchers through the process.

“Write what you see,” Remiel instructed, “but also mark what you smell and feel. If you taste something, note its flavour without naming it yet. Later, when we teach the man, we will need words that evoke rather than dictate. We must resist the urge to define everything now.”

Rivqiel, still muddy from the flood training, pressed a fig leaf between two sheets of thin paper and traced its veins. “How do I write the smell?” he asked, perplexed.

Remiel handed him a small vial of oil. “Dip your cloth in the fig’s sap and press it to the page,” she suggested. “The scent will infuse the fiber. When you read this later, the memory of the smell will rise.”

Shomeriel took a slice of fruit and chewed thoughtfully. “How will we avoid imposing our preferences?” he asked. “I like sweet more than sour. If I write that this is the best, I might mislead.”

“Describe,” Saraqael replied, “do not judge. Say it is sweet, say it bursts, say it lingers. Do not say it is better. Leave that to the reader. Our task is to present, not to coerce. Remember: watchers testify.”

Penemue, who had joined to watch the exercise, raised an eyebrow. “But is not description itself a kind of persuasion?” he challenged. “Our choice of adjectives, our metaphors, they guide perception.”

Saraqael nodded. “Yes,” he said. “That is why humility must saturate every line. We know we cannot be objective, but we can be truthful and open-handed. We can invite rather than trap. We can name our own reactions as our own, not as universal truth.”

The Bright One passed by at that moment with Gadreel and Azazel. He listened to Saraqael’s answer and smiled. “Yet you will shape,” he murmured. “Testimony always shapes. The question is whether you will shape toward freedom or toward dependence on your own understanding.”

Saraqael met his gaze. “Freedom anchored in truth cannot be manipulated by testimony,” he replied. “It can be invited and nurtured. Lies might twist, but truth will straighten.”

The Bright One’s smile did not reach his eyes. “We shall see,” he said quietly, and he moved on toward a grove of cedars that caught his interest.

Not long after the exercise, Raphael and Sofiel gathered healers, messengers, and watchers in a grove fragrant with newly sprouted herbs. Among the wild mint and thyme stood a new angel, Yedidiel, whose hair was braided with rosemary and whose hands were stained green from crushing leaves. He was the steward of herbs, an encyclopaedia of plants’ properties. His eyes held both gentleness and precision. “The earth has given us medicines and spices,” Raphael announced. “We must learn to use them with discernment.”

Sofiel knelt among the plants and touched a low-growing patch of chamomile. “Each herb has a voice,” she said. “Chamomile whispers to sleepless minds. Lavender hums to anxious hearts. Rosemary sings to memory. But if we shout over them, we will miss their song.”

Yedidiel handed Haniel a sprig of thyme. “Smell and then listen,” he instructed. Haniel inhaled and then stilled. “It tells me to slow down,” he said softly. “It reminds me that flavour unfolds if I do not rush.”

Rivqiel watched, eager. “Will we make potions?” he asked. “Will we mix things to create wonders?”

Raphael smiled. “We will make teas and oils,” he answered. “We will steep herbs in water to draw out their essence. We will infuse oils with petals. But we will not concoct magic to coerce. The man’s healing will come from trust and consent, not from forcing his body to obey our will. Herbs will assist, not override.”

Penemue, lurking nearby, interjected with curiosity. “Is there a difference between using knowledge to help and using it to control?” he asked. “If you know chamomile calms, why not give it to calm anyone whether they ask or not? Is that not mercy?”

Sofiel shook her head. “Mercy honours choice,” she said. “If we put chamomile in someone’s drink without their knowledge, we take away their agency. Healing must be offered, not imposed. It is like water to a thirsty man: offer; do not force.”

Yedidiel added, “Each herb has potency. Too much can harm. If we administer without listening, we can wound. We must ask: is our motive love or impatience?”

Raphael gestured to a row of broad-leafed plants with thick roots. “These will be bitter,” he said. “They cleanse. They expel sickness. The man will resist bitterness. He will prefer sweetness. We must teach him that some good things taste harsh. We must invite him to trust our counsel. Bitter herbs are like hard truths: they heal if received.”

Saraqael wrote this down, noting the parallel. “We should prepare our metaphors carefully,” he murmured to Safriel. “Bitterness in herbs as bitterness in counsel. Sweetness in fruit as sweetness in blessing. Our stories will teach if they mirror creation.”

Yedidiel reached for a basket and began to teach them how to dry herbs. “Hang them upside down so oils travel to the flowers,” he said. “Store them in a cool, dark place. Label them, but label them humbly: not as cures but as companions. When you record, note the circumstances as much as the effect. A tea offered with love heals more than one offered with condescension.”

Sofiel picked up a handful of sage and rubbed it between her palms, releasing its scent. “We must also teach the man and his descendants to ask permission before harvesting,” she emphasised. “Herbs are not endless. Plants give of themselves. Overharvest harms the soil and the giver. Consent extends to the earth. Choriel will testify if the land is grieved.”

Choriel, who had joined quietly, nodded. “The soil remembers plucking,” he affirmed. “If plucking is careless, the soil tightens. If plucking is grateful, it loosens. I will teach him to thank the earth with each pull. Gratitude is not just a word; it is a posture that leaves the soil willing.”

Yedidiel concluded the session by preparing a small infusion. He placed mint leaves in a clay cup, poured hot water (created by Nuriel’s gentle flame) over them, and let them steep. He covered the cup with his palm as if listening. After a few moments, he passed the cup to Penemue. “Taste,” he invited.

Penemue sipped and frowned. “Too bitter,” he said. “Not pleasant.”

Yedidiel smiled. “You sipped before it was ready,” he explained. “Waiting is part of the extraction. Herbs release their sweetness in time. You must let them sit.” He took the cup, waited a few moments longer, then offered it to Shomeriel. Shomeriel tasted and his expression softened. “It is gentle now,” he said. “It warms me.”

“Patience and listening,” Yedidiel said, looking at Penemue. “You can either drink too soon and receive bitterness or wait and receive gentleness. This is true for herbs and for counsel.”

Penemue shrugged, but he filed the metaphor away. The Bright One, who had approached to observe, watched the process carefully. He saw the value of herbs and the influence of those who controlled them. He imagined how offering the man knowledge of herbs could win allegiance. He imagined how one could withhold herbs to coerce. He said nothing, but his mind turned the leaves of possibility.

Sofiel, sensing his thoughts, lifted her chin. “Remember, Bright One,” she said gently, “knowledge of creation is a gift to steward, not a weapon. May our hands always heal rather than bind.”

The Bright One bowed his head slightly, a gesture of respect or concealment. “Of course,” he said. “We learn to serve.”

Raphael prayed silently that it would be so. The herbs swayed, releasing more fragrance, as if agreeing.

Later in the day, Chroniel and Kairosiel called a meeting with Orifiel and the newly named Aspheriel, an angel of grasses, slender and golden, whose hair swayed like wheat. They met in a glade where tall grasses waved like a sea. Each blade seemed to dance to an unseen rhythm, bending and returning.

“We must speak of rhythms,” Chroniel began, plucking a grass blade and running his fingers along its edge. “So far, time has been pulses. Light appeared, waters separated, land emerged. But now we see cycles in the plants. We must attune ourselves to them so we can teach.”

Orifiel nodded. “When lights appear, we will mark seasons,” he said. “But already the earth has cycles. Dew rises and falls. Sap flows, then stills. There are small sabbaths in each day.”

Kairosiel touched the grass gently. “Each blade knows when to rise and when to lie down,” he observed. “There are appointed times for germination and dormancy. These are kairos moments on a small scale. The man will need to know when to sow and when to reap.”

Aspheriel spoke, her voice a whisper like wind through fields. “Grasses are like breath,” she said. “They exhale oxygen. They inhale carbon. They serve without recognition. They feed beasts and men. Their pattern is humility. Teaching this will require humility from us. We must not despise the small.”

Chroniel laughed softly. “Nothing is small in significance,” he said. “The man will step on grasses every day. He will not think of them often, yet his life will depend on them. That is a lesson in itself: unnoticed gifts sustain us. Gratitude is due even when awareness is absent. Perhaps our records should include blank spaces to honour what was given without thanks.”

Saraqael, who had joined them to take notes, scribbled a symbol of a small blade next to a blank line. “A space for the unnamed,” he said aloud. “We should instruct our successors to leave room for gratitude they cannot yet articulate.”

They discussed at length how to integrate these cycles into their record-keeping and teaching. They proposed a festival for the man and his descendants — a feast of first fruits — long before there would be descendants, to honour the Giver at each harvest. Orifiel suggested a fallow year, a year of rest for the land. Chroniel considered leaving a thread slack every seventh cycle to mark rest. Kairosiel mused about doors within cycles where God would meet them uniquely. They all felt the weight of pattern and the joy of planning for a future that their current audience (the man not yet breathed) did not yet know. Their conversation was both practical and prophetic. They were building liturgy.

As the sunless evening approached, the adversary’s camp gathered under the boughs of a massive fig tree. The Bright One had called them to discuss what they had observed. Gadreel, Azazel, Penemue, Shomeriel, Thaliel, and others sat on smooth stones or leaned against trunks. Seeds and leaves clung to their robes, unnoticed.

“Today,” the Bright One began, his tone mild, “we witnessed life without will. Plants obey patterns. They do not choose to rebel. They do not ask questions. They produce because they must. Abundance flows because there is no freedom to resist. This is a kind of order that is… efficient.” He emphasised the last word, letting it hang.

Gadreel nodded. “It is predictable,” he said. “If we had a world of such life, we could plan without interference. We would not have to account for choice. We could calculate yield, control supply. Scarcity would vanish if everything produced as commanded.”

Penemue fingered a grape. “And yet there is rot,” he pointed out. “Fruit falls. Spoilage happens. It seems wasteful. Could we not design a system where nothing decays? Where everything is consumed at optimum time?”

Azazel grinned. “We could gather all fallen fruit and store it,” he suggested. “But then those ants would starve.”

Shomeriel frowned. “Is storing not simply stewardship?” he asked. “We have been told the man will steward. Storing extra for famine times seems wise.”

“Wisdom is in the eye of the steward,” the Bright One replied. “If the man is to steward, why not guide him to steward everything, including his own destiny? If pattern is embedded, perhaps he can learn to manipulate it to accelerate growth. If he can increase yield, he can control his environment. Control brings security.”

Thaliel hesitated. “But does control not breed fear?” she whispered. “If I believe I must control everything to be secure, then I will fear what I cannot control. I am learning that boundaries and rhythms free me from fear.”

Penemue looked at her curiously. “You sound like Rahab,” he teased. “Careful, you might lose your edge.”

The Bright One intervened. “We are not anti-boundary,” he said smoothly. “We seek to refine boundaries. We ask whether patterns can be optimised. We do not accept inefficiency. Abundance could be more abundant if guided by intellect. Imagine if the man learned to graft branches to make multiple fruits on one tree. Imagine if he found a way to grow without seasons. Imagine if he created a storehouse for himself and his allies. Would that not demonstrate partnership with the Creator rather than defiance?”

Gadreel’s eyes gleamed. “We could frame our counsel,” he mused, “as an invitation to use intellect for improvement. We would not say, ‘Reject God’s patterns.’ We would say, ‘Improve them.’ We would appeal to his desire to imitate the Creator.”

Thaliel felt unease coil in her stomach. “What if the Creator’s patterns are already perfect?” she asked quietly.

Azazel smirked. “Perfection is a moving target,” he said. “We can always add. We can always enhance.”

The Bright One smiled benevolently, masking the impatience within. “We will test these ideas when the time comes,” he said. “For now, observe. Learn. Find weaknesses in pattern and imagine how blessing can be redirected. When lights appear and seasons come, watch how they constrain growth. Constraint is opportunity.”

Shomeriel shifted uncomfortably, remembering the sapling saved from the flood and the cracked earth waiting for rain. He wondered if improvement meant ignoring lament or waiting. He decided to listen more and speak less.

As the day closed, the hosts gathered again to worship amidst the abundant land. They chose a clearing where grasses formed a natural amphitheater and fruit trees arched overhead like cathedral columns. Seraphina began a song that echoed the patterns they had observed. Each stanza described a seed sprouting, a vine climbing, a fruit ripening. Each chorus returned to a refrain of gratitude:

Chorus
Blessed be the pattern woven in earth,
Seeds within fruit, fruit within seed;
Bless the Giver for cycles of birth,
And bless the hands that learn to heed.

Haniel danced in circles that widened then narrowed then widened again, his movements mirroring the spiral of ferns unfurling. Matariel punctuated the chorus with gentle showers that glittered in the light. Floriel scattered petals that caught on wings and glowed. Choriel swayed like a mountain in the wind, his deep voice adding a drone beneath Seraphina’s melody. Aspheriel swished through the grasses, the sound a soft percussion.

Raphael and Sofiel prepared a simple feast of figs, wheat cakes (miraculously formed by God’s command for the practice), and pomegranates. They passed them among the angels, inviting them to taste and sing. The act of eating became worship, each bite a sacrament. They practised blessing: before and after each bite, they whispered, “Thank You, Giver.” It felt odd to some, as if stating the obvious, but soon it became a rhythm.

Saraqael kept his journal open, letting a fig leaf stain the page. He wrote down phrases from the song and sketched the spiral of Haniel’s dance. He noted the pattern: observe, taste, bless, rest. He wrote, Blessing is pattern. Gratitude is rhythm. Without gratitude, abundance curdles.

The Bright One stood at the edge of the gathering. He sang softly, blending his voice with the chorus. For a moment, his eyes softened. He remembered his own first awakening, the joy of being created by command and the thrill of seeing light and water and now land and fruit. He had a moment of clarity: all of this was gift. But then he thought of waste again — of fruit falling uneaten, of patterns that could be optimised — and his heart clenched. He turned away before the song ended.

Later, after worship, God invited a small group — Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Saraqael, Chroniel, Kairosiel, Haniel, and the Bright One — to a quiet grove. The grove held a variety of trees: olive, fig, cedar, pine. In the center, a single sapling sprouted, tiny and tender. God knelt beside it, His hand hovering protectively.

“This is an almond tree,” He said softly. “It is the first of its kind. It will wake early in seasons when seasons come. It will herald new cycles. I am entrusting it to you, watchers and guardians, to care for it. Let it be a reminder that life begins without moral choice but always with purpose. Let it remind you that pattern can be prophecy. When you see it bloom in future ages, know that My promises are near.”

Michael leaned in. “Why this tree, Lord?” he asked.

“Because it listens,” God answered simply. “Almond trees wake before others. They anticipate My word. Their pattern is watchfulness. It is a living symbol. Saraqael, note this. Chroniel, measure its time to bloom. Kairosiel, watch for the door it opens. Haniel, write a song about this tree. Bright One, remember this — every pattern points back to Me. Do not let your heart turn patterns into idols.”

The Bright One nodded slowly, his eyes on the sapling. He said nothing, but his mind raced. Patterns as prophecy, patterns as power. He would remember. He would use the knowledge; whether in submission or in challenge, he did not yet decide.
