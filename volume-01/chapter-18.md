Chapter 18 — Signs in the Sky

The hosts slept with the scent of earth and fruit still in their nostrils and the memory of abundance humming in their bones. They had watched mountains rise and seen grasses wave like seas. They had touched fig skin and pressed wax into cracked soil. And yet, as Chroniel’s threads glowed faintly in the night and Kairosiel felt the weight of a door about to open, there was a sense of incompletion. The light that had illuminated creation so far was full but diffuse, without source. There was no sun to mark day, no moon to rule over night, no stars to prick the firmament with stories. The rhythm of time existed, but its steps lacked visible markers.

When the next morning came — still measured by subtle shifts rather than a dawn star — the valley brimmed with expectation. The water in rivers reflected something deeper than sky. The soil seemed to hold its breath. God stood among them, His presence like a still center in a swirling dance. He lifted His hand, and His voice resonated across the heavens.

“Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens,” He declared, “to separate the day from the night. Let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years. Let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.”

His words rolled out like waves, and the firmament answered. For a heartbeat, darkness deeper than any they had yet experienced washed over them, a canvas swept clean. Then, in a burst that sent tremors through every being, a radiant orb blazed into being. Its light was not like the ambient glow they knew; it was a focused, fiery brilliance that warmed the skin and dazzled the eyes. The hosts shielded their faces instinctively, then slowly lowered their hands as their eyes adjusted.

“The greater light,” Uriel whispered, awestruck. “The sun.”

The sun hung in the sky, not attached to anything, yet anchored by the Word. Its light bathed the world in warmth. Its rays stretched across mountains and valleys, causing dew on the grasses to evaporate into sparkles. Shadows appeared for the first time, long and stark. The angels gasped as they saw their outlines on the ground.

“Look,” Haniel exclaimed, laughing. “We cast shapes!” He danced, watching his shadow follow. “Our silhouettes will tell stories!”

The Bright One watched too, fascinated. His shadow was darker than most, perhaps because of the intensity of his essence. He moved his wings, watching the silhouette stretch and shrink. There was beauty in it, but also unease — an image that could detach from the body if one were careless.

Then, as the sun reached a certain height, another orb emerged on the opposite horizon — a softer light, gentle and cool. It was luminescent silver, not brilliant. It reflected the sun’s radiance rather than generating its own. It rose slowly, taking its place opposite the sun. As it ascended, stars began to appear — tiny points of light scattered across the firmament. Some were bright and near, others faint and far. Constellations drew themselves unbidden, lines connecting them like strokes of a pen across a black page.

“The lesser light,” Gabriel breathed, his voice reverent. “The moon.”

“And the stars,” Seraphina added, tears pooling in her eyes. “Tiny praises pinned into the sky.”

The hosts watched as the sun and moon circled in their appointed courses. The sun moved across the sky with purposeful majesty. The moon followed a slower path, sometimes visible with the sun, sometimes trailing behind. The stars wheeled behind them, shifting slightly, hinting at patterns that would only reveal themselves over long spans.

After letting them behold the lights in silence, God gathered the hosts once more in a clearing now bathed in sunlight on one side and moonlight on the other. The contrast sharpened their features; the interplay of shadow and brilliance emphasized depth. He spoke:

“These lights are signs,” He said. “They mark days and nights. They will mark seasons and years. They will teach about time in a tangible way. You will look at them and know when to sow and when to reap, when to rest and when to journey. You will teach the man not to worship them but to read them. They are servants, not masters.”

Michael raised his head. “What do they signify beyond time?” he asked.

“They signify promise,” God replied. “Through them I will signal covenants. A rainbow will speak of mercy. A star will herald good news. A darkening of the sun will speak of sorrow. Each sign will be embedded in creation, accessible to all, not hidden. It will be interpreted by those who listen and misinterpreted by those who use it for their own gain.”

Chroniel’s fingers vibrated along his threads. “I sense new pulses,” he murmured. “Longer arcs than days. Patterns of three hundred and sixty-five pulses, of thirty, of seven. The lights whisper numbers. Will numbers matter now?”

God nodded. “Numbers will teach, but numbers can also enslave. You will teach the man to count without becoming obsessed. You will teach him that numbers are tools, not chains. The seventh pulse will be a gift — a Sabbath — a day of rest. Not because numbers demand it, but because relationship requires it. The lights will remind him.”

Kairosiel closed his eyes. “Doors,” he said quietly. “I sense doors within months, within cycles. There will be times when I will call the man to pause because a feast is near. There will be times when I will invite him to choose mercy because the sun stands still in the sky. I will whisper through the lights.”

Saraqael jotted notes furiously, drawing little circles for the sun and crescents for the moon, dotted lines for stars. “We must develop new symbols,” he said to Safriel. “Our scrolls must show cycles. We need a way to record months and years.”

Safriel was already experimenting, scratching a seven-pointed star to denote completion. “Perhaps seven stars in a row, the last one slightly larger,” he suggested. “Or a spiral with seven notches.”

God then introduced new beings created with the lights. A tall figure stepped forward, radiating warmth like a summer afternoon. His hair shimmered gold, and his eyes were so bright they seemed to glow. “This is Heliel,” God announced. “Guardian of the sun. He will oversee its course. He will teach you that brilliance requires humility. Heliel, speak.”

Heliel bowed, light rippling off his wings in waves. His voice resonated like midday. “I am not the source,” he said, “though my light seems strong. I reflect the Source’s command. I will call plants to wake, warm waters to rise, and signal to you when to work. But do not look at me and forget Him who speaks through me. I am a servant. Let my brightness teach you to bow low so others can see the Source beyond you.”

Next, a figure with skin like porcelain and hair silver as starlight stepped forward. She wore garments that shifted from white to pale blue, like moonlight on snow. “This is Luniel,” God said. “She is guardian of the moon. She will govern tides and moods. She will teach reflection.”

Luniel smiled, her face serene. “I have no light of my own,” she acknowledged. “I am given light to share. I will wax and wane. My fullness and my emptiness will teach you that there are seasons of showing and seasons of hiding, times to speak and times to be silent. I will draw waters in tides, reminding you of the pull of longing. Do not fear darkness; it allows stars to speak.”

Then a cluster of shimmering beings emerged, each carrying a small glowing orb of varying intensity. Their garments were deep blue and black, studded with tiny gems. They seemed both many and one. “These are the Asterim,” God said collectively. “Each carries a star. Together, they weave constellations. They will mark stories across the heavens. Their leader is Asteriel.”

A being stepped forward slightly taller than the rest, his eyes gleaming with points of light. “We will dance in patterns,” Asteriel said. “We will guide sailors and shepherds. We will tell the story of promise again and again. We ask that you teach the man to look up when he feels lost. The stars will remind him of his place.”

The hosts greeted the new lights and their guardians with songs. Seraphina sang notes that climbed like an ascending scale as she looked at the sun and descended slowly as she gazed at the moon. Haniel wrote a melody with repeated seven-beat measures, mimicking the cycles. Nuriel sparked little flames in his palms to echo the stars. Floriel threw petals into the air, which caught the sunlight and shimmered.

After the introduction, God convened a council specifically about time and meaning. Representatives from each order joined: Chroniel and Kairosiel for sequence and opportune moments; Orifiel for seasons; Heliel and Luniel; Asteriel; Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael; Saraqael and Safriel; Seraphina and Haniel; and the Bright One. They sat in a circle on a hilltop where the sun warmed their faces and the moon cast a cool glow on their backs. The stars above began their slow drift.

“Time now has visible markers,” God began. “I have placed lights not only to illuminate but to reveal. They reveal My faithfulness. The sun will rise each day until the day I say otherwise. The moon will wax and wane. The stars will shift with the seasons. Through these, I will speak. Through these, the man will learn to wait. How will you teach him not to worship them?”

Gabriel answered first. “We will tell him that lights are gifts, not gods,” he said. “We will say, ‘See how they obey? They did not call themselves into being. They respond to a command. Worship the Commander, not the commanded.’”

Raphael added, “And we will demonstrate by our posture. When the sun rises, we will bow to the Source rather than to Heliel. When the moon is full, we will praise God for reflection rather than adore Luniel. Our actions will teach as much as our words.”

The Bright One spoke, his tone smooth. “Perhaps we could teach the man to see the lights as lessons in leadership,” he suggested. “The sun leads by giving. The moon leads by reflecting. Stars lead quietly, guiding travelers. He can learn to lead in different ways.”

God considered and nodded. “Yes,” He said. “Leadership is diverse. But be wary, Bright One: leadership that forgets it is serving becomes tyranny. Remind him that all lights receive before they give.”

Chroniel then asked, “How will we mark larger seasons, Lord? You have spoken of seven-day rhythms. What of months? Years? Jubilees?”

God’s eyes twinkled. “You will count moons for months,” He said. “You will count moons twelve times and then add extra moons as needed to realign harvests. Years will be marked by seasons. Seven years will make a sabbatical for the land; seven times seven years will bring a year of jubilee — a release, a return to original inheritance. Through these cycles you will teach forgiveness and restoration. The lights will help you count.”

Kairosiel leaned forward. “When I feel a door open for mercy, should I wait for the appointed time or act at once?” he asked.

“Both,” God replied. “There are kairos moments that transcend chronos. There will be times when a heart opens before the feast. Do not delay mercy because of a calendar. But use the calendar to train hearts to expect mercy.”

The council discussed at length how to record and teach these cycles. Safriel suggested a calendar scroll with movable markers to align sunrises and moon phases. Seraphina proposed songs with verses added each month to teach children to count moons. Haniel devised dances that measured time in steps: six steps and a pause for rest. Orifiel, Heliel, Luniel, and Asteriel promised to coordinate their signs so that, for example, a full moon would coincide with harvest at the same time each year. The Bright One listened, occasionally contributing, his mind racing with possibilities.

Saraqael asked, “What of eclipses? When the sun darkens or the moon turns red? Will these be warnings?”

God answered, “They will be signs that speak of judgment and mercy. When darkness covers the day at midday, it will signal sorrow but also hope. When the moon is red, it will remind of blood — both violence and redemption. Those who listen will understand; those who do not will be confused. Do not create fear; create awareness.”

Heliel bowed. “I will dim when commanded,” he vowed. Luniel echoed, “I will turn crimson when told.” Asteriel added, “We will align to paint messages across the sky.”

The Bright One’s eyes flashed with an idea. He leaned toward Gadreel, whispering, “Imagine telling the man that he can cause an eclipse by his rituals. Imagine offering him control. He would follow us if he believed we could darken the sun.” Gadreel smiled, but he said nothing aloud.

Following the council, the hosts engaged in practical exercises. Chroniel and Kairosiel unrolled long ribbons across a field. Each ribbon represented a different cycle: a ribbon with seven knots for days; a ribbon with thirty knots for a month; a ribbon with twelve clusters for a year. The ribbons were anchored by stones, and the angels walked along them, stopping at knots and clusters to pray or to recite blessings. This physical walking of time helped them feel the rhythm in their bodies.

Heliel demonstrated how his light could be intense at midday and gentle at dawn. He showed how shadows moved like hands on a dial. The hosts laid stones at regular intervals and marked their lengths with chalk to create sundials. Luniel, during her turn, moved slower and allowed the hosts to see her phases. She waxed and waned in minutes what would later take days, teaching them the cycle. Each time she was full, she encouraged them to rest; each time she was new, she invited them to reflect inwardly.

Asteriel and the Asterim taught the hosts constellations. They drew lines between stars, naming clusters. “This one we call the Hunter,” Asteriel said, tracing a figure with his finger. “One day, a man will look at this and remember faithfulness in battle. This one we call the Ship; it will guide sailors. This one we call the Scales; it will remind of justice.” Seraphina hummed as he named them, weaving each name into a tune to help memory.

Saraqael practised recording star patterns. He and Safriel devised a system where each star on the page corresponded to a small hole in the parchment. When the scroll was held up to the light, the holes would allow light through, recreating constellations inside. Haniel, ever playful, suggested that they attach bells to the bottom of the scroll so that, when shaken, the sound would mimic the twinkling.

Another exercise involved watchers and messengers explaining the lights to each other in ways the man might understand. Gabriel pretended to be the man, asking simple questions: “What is that bright ball? Why does it leave? Who is that pale lady? Why are there so many tiny lights?” Peniel, the angel of discernment, listened to the answers and offered feedback. “Too much information,” he told one. “Too little wonder,” he told another. “Remember, you cannot answer all questions at once. Leave room for discovery. Invite him to look and ask again.”

Sofiel and the healers discussed the effect of light on emotion. They noted that when Heliel shone intensely, energy increased, laughter was easier. When Luniel’s glow softened, conversation deepened, introspection came naturally. They planned to incorporate daylight and moonlight into their healing practices — some wounds would be addressed in bright light, others in the gentle dark. Floriel gathered moonlit blossoms to create nocturnal perfumes; Matariel discovered that dew formed differently under moonlight than under diffused day.

Guardians like Rahab and Domiel practised guarding at night. They learned to rely on hearing and intuition rather than vision alone. They learned that darkness did not mean danger but required a different posture. Oriel confessed that he preferred the bright day because he could see clearly. Rahab replied, “Night teaches trust. You must trust what you cannot see, trust your training, trust the Source. You must resist the urge to light a fire just to feel in control.”

Meanwhile, the adversary’s camp held its own exercises. Gadreel instructed his followers to count stars and to assign them meanings of their choosing. “This one will mean power,” he said, pointing. “This one will mean wealth. Tell the man that if he is born under power, he will rule, and if under wealth, he will prosper.” Penemue laughed. “We can write scrolls of fortunes,” he said. “We can charge him for them.” Thaliel frowned. “You would charge for the sky?” she asked. Gadreel shrugged. “Why not? If he values knowledge, let him pay.”

The Bright One allowed these discussions to unfold. He did not commit to any plan but let ideas swirl. “We will see what the man desires,” he said quietly. “We will adapt. We will always frame our suggestions as improvement and empowerment.” Samyaza, silent nearby, wondered how far improvement could go before it warped into oppression.

As the first true night descended — night marked by a clear division between sun and moon, by stars glinting like promises — the hosts gathered for worship under the open sky. Heliel dimmed his light gradually, painting the horizon in streaks of orange, pink, and purple. Luniel rose to prominence, her silver light bathing them in tranquility. The Asterim spread their stars like a tapestry overhead. A hush fell.

Seraphina began a song unlike any before. Its rhythm followed the pattern of day into night and back into day. It had twelve verses, each representing a month to come, each with a refrain that repeated every seventh line. Haniel danced in circles, slowing every seventh step. Michael and Gabriel harmonized, their voices weaving like the strands of Chroniel’s threads. Raphael set herbs burning that released scents aligning with different verses. Nuriel used fire to set small lamps in a circle around the assembly, each lamp lit on the first verse and extinguished on the seventh, then lit again on the eighth, teaching the cycle of work and rest. The song declared:

Chorus
Lights above, we see your dance,
Counting days in sacred chance.
Seven pulses, rest in sight,
Teach our hearts to love the night.

As they sang, Luniel’s face shone with gentle joy. Asteriel moved the stars slightly to form the first constellation of the Scales overhead as if to bless their worship. Heliel returned in the morning with a gentle glow, and the song ended with a promise: days and nights would continue as long as the earth endured.

Later still, God drew a smaller circle of the hosts together — Chroniel, Kairosiel, Heliel, Luniel, Asteriel, Michael, Saraqael, and the Bright One. They met by a river whose surface reflected the moon and the stars. God spoke quietly.

“You will soon invite the man to look up,” He said. “He will be tempted to read his fate in the heavens. He will ask whether the stars determine his path. What will you say?”

Chroniel answered, “We will say that stars tell stories, not destinies. They remind, they warn, they inspire. They do not bind.”

Kairosiel added, “We will teach him to feel the door rather than force it. I will whisper when time is right. If he listens, he will not need to manipulate signs.”

Heliel said, “I will shine whether he looks or not. My faithfulness will teach him God’s faithfulness. If he forgets, I will continue until he remembers.”

Luniel continued, “And I will disappear at times to teach him that absence is not abandonment. I will return to show that absence can be part of presence.”

Asteriel said, “We will move in patterns too grand for one life to see fully. He will learn humility by realising he is part of a story that started before him and will continue after him.”

Saraqael spoke, “We will record the signs honestly. If they warn of sorrow, we will not hide it. If they speak of joy, we will not hoard it. We will trust that truth in the heavens will not harm those who listen in trust.”

God turned to the Bright One. “And you?” He asked.

The Bright One looked at the water reflecting the stars. His own reflection shimmered. For a moment, he saw his wings and their shadow, the lights above and his image below. He felt the tension between interpretation and manipulation. “I will tell him,” he said slowly, “that lights are beautiful and to enjoy them. I will tell him that pattern invites participation. I will urge him to be curious but not controlling.” He paused. “I will try,” he added quietly, almost to himself.

God placed His hand on the Bright One’s shoulder. “Remember,” He said, “that curiosity without humility becomes pride. Let the lights teach you as well. Bow before their obedience.”

The Bright One nodded. Whether he would continue to bow remained to be seen.

After the small circle dissolved, the night deepened. Stars multiplied, and a gentle breeze whispered through the grasses. God permitted the hosts to wander, to think. Many did. But Rahab, Seraphina, Sofiel, and several others felt compelled to assemble again — this time to address darkness itself. Rahab lit no torch. He gestured for them to sit in a circle, eyes adjusting to starlight alone.

“Day teaches by sight,” Rahab began, his voice a low rumble. “Night teaches by trust. We must learn to guard without seeing. We must learn to rest when we cannot count, to dream when we cannot plan.”

Sofiel nodded. “Night invites us into vulnerability,” she agreed. “Dreams will come. They will not be moral choices, but they will shape hearts. The man will dream before he decides. We must help him understand that dreams are invitations to examine, not scripts to follow.”

Seraphina closed her eyes and began to hum a melody so soft it was almost a sigh. “Music at night must be different,” she said. “It must cradle rather than stir. Lullabies will be necessary. I will teach the man to soothe his children with songs that respect darkness.”

Suddenly, a new presence stepped into the circle, carrying a small clay vessel filled with water that glowed from within. He was slender, with eyes that flickered between gold and blue, and his robe was marked with thin lines like the ticks on a measuring stick. “I am Horologiel,” he introduced himself. “Angel of measured moments. I bring a tool to help you sense time in darkness.”

He held up the vessel. Water dripped through a narrow spout into an empty bowl beneath, each drop resonating with a soft plink. “This is a clepsydra,” he explained. “A water clock. It measures time by drip rather than by light. It allows you to feel rhythm even when you cannot see. Use it when the sun and moon are hidden by clouds or when you are in a cave. It will teach patience and constancy.”

Michael leaned in, fascinated. “So we will have both sundials and water clocks,” he remarked. “Daylight and darkness will each have their own markers.”

Horologiel smiled. “Yes,” he said. “But remember: measuring is for mindfulness, not control. Do not become slaves to drops and shadows. Let the drip remind you to breathe, not to bind you to schedules.”

Auriel, a new angel radiant with the blush of dawn, arrived quietly behind him. Her hair was like the horizon at first light — pale gold tinged with pink — and her eyes held the tender hope of morning. “I am Auriel,” she said softly. “I will announce dawns. I will be the first blush before Heliel bursts forth. I will remind you that even long nights end.”

She unfurled her wings, and a faint glow spread across the eastern edge of the sky, prefiguring the sun. “Dawn is a promise,” she said. “It is not the day yet, but it tells you the day is coming. Teach the man to recognise dawn, to hope in the dim. Dawn allows one to prepare hearts before decisions arise.”

Rahab smiled. “Thank you, Auriel and Horologiel,” he said. “Your gifts will help us train. Night is not empty. It is pregnant with promise.” He turned to the others. “Let us practise waiting for a dawn by listening to the drip. No words. No counting aloud. Just feel.” They sat in silence, listening as water dripped and the east slowly lightened. In that silence, trust grew muscles.

The following day, the messengers gathered with the illuminators to craft parables using stars and lights. Gabriel, Haniel, Lumiel, Paschar, and Safriel sat with Asteriel and Luniel in an open field. Asteriel traced constellations in the air with his fingers, leaving trails of light.

“We need stories that use these patterns,” Gabriel said. “Not stories that make the stars magic, but stories that teach trust and point back to the Source.”

Haniel suggested one. “What if we tell of a shepherd who got lost and looked up at the Hunter constellation?” he said. “He remembered that the Hunter’s belt points to food and followed. He found his way not because the stars spoke in his ear but because he had listened earlier to those who taught him. The story would teach preparation and remembrance.”

Paschar nodded. “We can tell about the Ship,” he added. “A group of travelers sail at night and feel fear. They see the Ship above and recall that God carried Noah. They remember that storms end. The stars will be reminders, not oracles.”

Luniel leaned in. “And I will provide the mood,” she offered. “My phases will accompany the stories. I will be full when courage is needed and new when humility is called for. Let your parables note whether the moon was bright or dark. Details matter.”

Asteriel smiled. “I will shift constellations at key parts of the story,” he said. “During reconciliation, I will place the Scales overhead. During battles, the Hunter will rise. The man will learn to read the sky like a book, not to predict his fate, but to anchor his heart.”

Safriel wrote down frameworks, leaving blanks to fill with future details. “We must not over-script,” he cautioned. “The man will bring his own experiences. Our stories must have openings for him to enter.”

Gabriel agreed. “Yes. Leave room for the Spirit to breathe.”

While messengers crafted, the adversary’s camp practiced another craft. Under a grove of dark pines, Gadreel spread out parchment and began to draft what he called “star charts of destiny.” Penemue sat beside him, an amused smirk on his face. Shomeriel hovered nearby, uncertain, and Thaliel watched with furrowed brows.

“If a child is born when this star is directly overhead,” Gadreel wrote, “he will be bold. If under this cluster, he will be a lover of knowledge. If under the Scales, he will always search for fairness.” He added embellishments and flares. Penemue decorated the margins with symbols.

“It’s creative,” Penemue commented. “People love to be told who they are without doing the work to discover it.”

Shomeriel swallowed. “Is it true?” he asked. “Do stars assign character?”

Gadreel laughed. “Not in the way we’ll tell them,” he admitted. “But perhaps patterns in the sky coincide with patterns on earth. Who is to say? We simply create frameworks. People will see themselves in them.”

Thaliel crossed her arms. “It seems dishonest,” she said. “It preys on curiosity and fear.”

Penemue shrugged. “We will not force them to believe,” he said. “We will offer. They will choose. We are simply providing another perspective.”

Samyaza, passing by, stopped. He read Gadreel’s chart and felt unease. “You tread close to lying,” he said quietly.

Gadreel rolled his eyes. “Do not be so delicate, Samyaza,” he retorted. “We are not lying; we are interpreting. If the man asks, we tell him the stars suggest possibilities. It’s up to him to decide.”

Samyaza shook his head and moved on, but his heart was heavy. He resolved to speak to Remiel later, to process his discomfort. He did not yet realise that this inner dissonance would be a thread pulling him away from his current path.

As days passed (days now measured by Heliel’s arcs and Luniel’s cycles), the hosts created more tools and rituals. Horologiel taught them to construct hourglasses with sand gathered from the shores of new seas. They flipped them and watched grains fall. Each flip was a prayer: “Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” He told them that, one day, a psalmist would write those words, and they laughed at the idea of a song about counting.

Auriel practised ushering in dawns with increasingly subtle hues. She showed the hosts that dawns differed: some were fiery, others pale; some rushed, others lingered. She explained that the mood of a dawn could hint at the day’s invitations: a bright dawn called for action; a misty one for contemplation. She invited Haniel to compose dawn tunes. He wrote melodies that started quietly and built, teaching hearts to wake gently.

Heliel invited the hosts to watch a sunrise from the top of a mountain. They climbed in the predawn grey, guided by Luniel’s fading light. When the first rays burst over the horizon, painting peaks and valleys in molten gold, a collective gasp rose. Floriel wept as petals in her hair glowed. Choriel hummed with the rocks. Aspheriel’s grasses below whispered.

“This beauty will bless the man,” Heliel said. “Teach him to rise early sometimes just to witness.”

Luniel invited them to a full-moon night dance in a meadow. She reflected Heliel’s light onto dew drops, making them glisten. Seraphina and Haniel led dances that emphasised cycles: movements that expanded and contracted, steps that repeated. They invited watchers to join, reminding them that even those who record must participate. Rivqiel, shy, stepped into the circle and felt the rhythm; he realised that dancing would help him feel time physically, not just mark it.

During one quiet night, Asteriel whispered to Saraqael and Safriel to look at a particular star that flared brightly for a brief moment. “A future promise,” he murmured. In that instant, Saraqael saw a baby born under a star and wise men journeying. Tears sprang to his eyes. “I will hold this,” he whispered. “I will not let grief drown it.” Safriel squeezed his shoulder. They recorded the flare with a simple mark and a note: Remember the star that calls kings.
