Chapter 14 — The Council of Voices

The silence before breath lingered like dew, saturating every surface of the
unseen realm. It was as if the valley and its watchers had become part of
one prolonged inhalation, waiting for the exhale that would animate the
form of dust. Yet while the host waited, they were not idle. The absence
of sound invited other senses to awaken. They saw more colors in the sky,
smelled new fragrances rising from the earth, and felt the hum of time
vibrating through Chroniel’s threads. Waiting became an arena for new
learning.

Michael stood at the eastern ridge, watching light shift from silver to
amber. “We have learned to wait,” he whispered to Gabriel. “Now we must
learn to speak.”

Gabriel nodded, his expression thoughtful. “We must prepare our voices so
that they serve rather than overpower. When breath comes, we will be
tempted to pour out everything we know. Our challenge is to invite rather
than instruct, to offer rather than impose.”

Raphael joined them, his hands clasped behind his back. “And to discern
when silence is still necessary,” he added. “Even after breath, there
will be moments when our presence must be felt rather than heard.”

Uriel approached, staff in hand, the tip glowing faintly as if holding a
stored spark. “The Source is convening a council,” he announced quietly.
“He desires to teach us how to speak to those who will be formed from
dust. The council will include all orders, for each gift will shape the
voice they bring.”

Michael’s eyes brightened. “Then we must gather the messengers, watchers,
healers, guardians, and artisans,” he said. “This is the council of
voices.”

They assembled in a circle large enough to hold the multitude but intimate
enough that each felt seen. At the center stood the Source. He did not
need elevation to be seen, but light emanated from Him in such a way that
each face was illuminated. Around Him stood representatives of every
order: Gabriel for the messengers, Saraqael for the watchers, Raphael for
the healers, Domiel and Rahab for the guardians, Orifiel for the
seasons, Lumiel for the illuminators, Seraphina for the singers,
Chroniel and Kairosiel for the timing keepers, and Epheriel for the
material guardians. The Bright One and his followers were present on
the outer ring, allowed by grace to hear but not to guide.

God spoke first. “You have seen the form and felt the silence,” He said.
“Now we will speak of speech. Words are the carriers of intent and
invitation. They can heal or harm, build or destroy, free or bind. The
man formed of dust will learn by words as well as by experience. You must
learn to speak in ways that honour freedom and truth.”

He looked at Gabriel. “Messenger,” He said, “what do you think your
message will be to the man when he awakens?”

Gabriel bowed. “I will greet him with blessing,” he said. “I will tell
him he is known and loved. I will deliver Your words, not my own.”

“And what tone will you use?” God asked.

Gabriel considered. “Gentle,” he replied. “Excited, but not
overwhelming. I will let him set the pace.”

God nodded and then turned to Saraqael. “Watcher, how will you speak
when he asks about events you have recorded?”

Saraqael straightened. “I will speak truthfully and fully,” he said. “I
will not omit sorrow or embellish joy. I will tell him what he asks and
wait to see if he desires more. I will not burden him with knowledge he
cannot yet bear.”

“What if he asks about the future?” God pressed.

“Then I will remind him that the future is a door opened by choices,”
Saraqael answered. “I will point him back to You and to the law of return.
I will not attempt to control his decisions through prediction.”

God’s gaze shifted to Raphael. “Healer, if he injures himself and asks
why pain exists, how will you answer?”

Raphael closed his eyes briefly. “I will say that pain is a signal,” he
said. “A teacher that something is broken. I will tell him that pain
invites attention, repentance, and healing. I will assure him that he is
not alone in pain and that I am present with him. I will ask for his
permission before touching his wound.”

God smiled. “Good,” He said. “Remember: your words must offer truth and
comfort without erasing the lesson within pain.”

Turning to Domiel and Rahab, God asked, “Guardians, if he approaches the
edge of the garden boundary, how will you speak?”

Domiel responded, voice like distant thunder tempered by tenderness. “I
will explain that boundaries are gifts,” he said. “That beyond them
exists danger not meant for him. I will not threaten or coerce. I will
use metaphor, perhaps describing the difference between a cliff and a
path.”

Rahab added, “If he crosses, I will not strike him down. I will remind
him of the law of return and the consequence built into creation. I will
stand ready to protect others, but I will respect his choice.”

God then turned to Orifiel. “Seasons keeper, when he complains of heat
or cold, what will you say?”

Orifiel smiled, his face reflecting spring and winter at once. “I will
tell him that seasons are teachers,” he replied. “That heat inspires
growth and cold invites rest. I will encourage him to see beauty in each
season and not to fight their rhythms. I will warn him that resisting
seasonal cycles may exhaust his body.”

Lumiel, the illuminator, stepped forward. “May I ask a question,
Lord?” he said.

“You may,” God replied.

“When we teach through parable,” Lumiel asked, “how do we ensure our
stories invite rather than manipulate? We have been warned about the
adversary’s plans to shape questions subtly.”

God answered, “A parable invites discovery when it leaves room for the
listener to interpret. It manipulates when it closes interpretation and
funnels to a predetermined conclusion. You must ask yourself why you are
telling the story. If it is to reveal My heart, let it be open. If it is
to convince, refrain.”

Lumiel bowed. “I will examine my intent,” he said.

Gadreel, standing in the outer ring near the Bright One, whispered
something to Azazel. Saraqael noted the movement. The watchers would
remember the whisper.

After the council session, smaller groups formed to practise speaking.
Gabriel gathered the messengers and watchers to role-play the man’s
first questions. Haniel sat cross-legged on the ground, volunteering to
pretend to be the man. He put on an exaggeratedly confused expression and
said, “Where am I?”

Gabriel smiled and replied, “You are in a garden created for you, a
gift. You are loved. Your name will be Adam, which means ground and
also man. You are both of earth and of God.”

Haniel continued the role-play. “What is love?” he asked, raising his
eyebrows dramatically.

Saraqael took this one. “Love is choosing the good of another, even at
cost to yourself,” he said. “Love is what made you. Love is what holds
you now.”

Zaphiel, eager to practise his storytelling, added, “Love is like a
vine that climbs up a tree. It needs support, but it gives beauty in
return.”

Paschar observed, then offered, “Or like a river that waters everything
it touches without asking to be thanked.”

The group laughed softly. Gabriel praised them. “These images will help
him understand,” he said. “We must remember to anchor abstract words in
concrete reality.”

Then Haniel asked, still playing, “Why am I made of dust?”

Epheriel stepped forward, his earthy robe shimmering. “Because dust
remembers humility,” he said. “Because being low allows you to look up.
Because you will understand that without breath, you are nothing. Dust
teaches you to depend on creation and to care for it in return.”

Haniel nodded, improvising. “Will I die?” he asked.

There was a pause. Even in role-play, the word carried weight. Remiel
answered, her tone gentle. “Your body will one day return to dust, but
your breath, given by God, will continue with Him. Death will not be the
end but a door. It will teach you to number your days so you live with
wisdom.”

Haniel, still in character, said, “That sounds sad.”

Muriel responded, “Sadness is part of love. Without sadness you cannot
understand joy. There will be grief, but there will also be comfort.”

The messengers practised more questions. They avoided answers that
promised control or removed responsibility. They learned to say, “I do
not know; ask Him,” when appropriate. The exercise revealed biases and
assumptions. Saraqael noted them for later reflection.

Simultaneously, another council formed a little distance away. This
gathering focused on the environment the man would inhabit. Orifiel
stood with Epheriel, Domiel, Nuriel, and other angels whose roles would
shape earth’s conditions. A large, translucent table appeared between
them, upon which images formed of mountains, rivers, animals, and
plants—the world in its potential.

Orifiel traced a circle on the table. “Seasons will turn around this
axis,” he said. “Spring will be gentle and full of newness. Summer will
be full of heat and growth. Autumn will invite letting go. Winter will
call to rest. We must ensure that the man does not fear the cold or the
heat but learns their purposes.”

Nuriel placed his finger near a small representation of a volcano. “Fire
will be within the earth as well as above it,” he said. “There will be
warmth for cooking and light, but there will also be danger. We must
teach him to respect fire as servant, not master.”

Epheriel spread his hands over the mountains. “These will supply stone,
metals, minerals,” he said. “He will learn to mine, to build. But he
must not exploit. The earth must be allowed to recover. We must plan
boundaries around resources so that greed does not strip the ground.
Perhaps areas closed off until he knows the cost.”

Domiel nodded. “Guardians will stand at those areas,” he said. “We will
explain, but we will also let him choose to respect or ignore. The law
of return will teach if he ignores. We must prepare to grieve as well.”

Rahab, though not part of this council, watched from the side and
interjected, “And we must ensure that no one else uses his need to
exploit him. Our boundaries will protect from external manipulation.”

Orifiel gestured at a representation of rain. “Water must fall from
above in patterns,” he said. “If he does not see rain for a season, he
might fear drought and strive beyond trust. We must design patterns that
teach both provision and reliance.”

Lumiel, invited to this council for his artistic eye, suggested,
“Perhaps the sky can tell him when rain is coming. Clouds will gather
like messengers. He will learn to read the sky and prepare. The beauty
will also invite worship.”

Epheriel nodded. “Yes, and we can embed nutrients in the soil that will
be released over time,” he said. “So that when he practices resting the
land, the soil replenishes itself. This will teach him the principle of
Sabbath in the ground.”

They discussed which animals would inhabit the garden first. “Small
creatures that will not frighten him,” suggested Tamiel, who had joined
as an artist. “Birds that sing in the morning, reminding him to
awaken. Deer that graze peacefully. Nothing that hunts, not at first.”

Nuriel added, “And then we will introduce creatures that challenge him
to manage. He will learn to shepherd, to care for those that rely on
him, reinforcing his role of stewardship.”

Kairosiel, standing near the edge of the table, pointed to a symbol of
a fruit tree. “There will be certain fruits that ripen only in season,”
she said. “These will teach him patience. If he picks them too early,
they will taste bitter. If he waits, they will be sweet. This is a
door.”

God, who had been quietly listening to their plans, nodded. “You are
thinking well,” He affirmed. “Remember: the environment is also a
teacher. It will preach without words. Do not remove all risk. Risk is
the context for trust.”

Meanwhile, deep within a hall formed of woven light, the watchers
gathered for their own council. Shelves rose around them, not yet
holding scrolls but ready to be filled. This would be the Library of
Sequence, the place where records written within time would be stored.
Chroniel, Remiel, Saraqael, Yomiel, Safriel, Chazaqiel, Petahel,
Seraphina, and other watchers took seats. Blank scrolls floated in
midair, held by threads that hummed softly.

Chroniel spoke first. “We must decide on formats for our records within
time,” he said. “We have used shimmering scrolls outside of sequence,
but we need patterns that will help future readers feel time. Safriel,
you suggested spacing and symbols. Tell us more.”

Safriel stood, his face bright with purpose. “In this library, some
scrolls will be chronological—each line corresponding to a pulse,” he
explained. “Others will be thematic—collecting occurrences of mercy,
justice, betrayal, redemption. Some will be sensory—capturing fragrance
or colour through words. We will also leave blank space as part of
storytelling.”

Remiel added, “We must also decide how much of our emotion we include.
Our records are meant to be accurate, but leaving out our feelings
distorts truth. We must write with honesty about our sorrow and our
joy.”

Yomiel nodded. “Yet we must not centre ourselves,” she cautioned. “Our
emotions are contextual, not primary. If we dwell on them, we risk
obscuring the Source’s story.”

Chazaqiel suggested, “Perhaps we can write two layers: one line for the
event and one line for our response. Future readers will see both and
discern the difference.”

Seraphina raised her hand. “Could we integrate song into the records?”
she asked. “A melody noted in the margin, indicating how we felt? A
future singer could play the song and feel our tone.”

Petahel smiled. “Or fragrance,” he added. “Muriel and I could create
vials of scent to attach to certain scrolls. When opened, the fragrance
would evoke the memory.”

Chroniel considered these suggestions. “We must also include warnings,”
he said. “Our records will not be neutral. They will speak to those who
read, including the adversary. We must be careful how we phrase
rebellion, lest our words be twisted.”

Saraqael agreed. “Let us commit to truth without flattery or bitterness,”
he said. “We will not vilify to make ourselves feel righteous. Nor will
we soften wrongdoing to avoid grief. Our records will invite
repentance.”

They spent hours discussing fonts of light, spacing, symbols, and
layering. By the end, they had drafted a framework: scrolls would
include event lines, response lines, symbol margins, blank spaces, and
optional sensory attachments. Safriel sketched prototypes. Remiel
described the emotional weight of the man’s formation using imagery from
their earlier exercise. Chroniel wove threads through the shelves,
creating slots where scrolls would hum with the pulse of time when
inserted. The Library of Sequence began to take form, even before its
first entry.

Across the field, the Bright One’s camp engaged in their own practice.
Under a canopy of twisting shadows, Gadreel stood before a group of
younger watchers and messengers who had begun to lean toward the
adversary’s philosophy. He held a scroll on which questions were
written.

“We must refine our method,” Gadreel said. “We will ask questions that
open rather than close, but we will seed doubt within them. Listen:
‘Have you considered that boundaries might exist to keep you from
discovering?’”

One of the younger ones, a messenger named Penemue, frowned. “That
sounds manipulative,” he said, though there was curiosity in his tone.

Gadreel smiled. “It is invitation,” he replied. “It opens a door. If
the man chooses to walk through, it is his choice.”

Azazel interjected, “We must be careful. We cannot violate the law of
consent. Our questions must be truthful in content, though weighted.”

Gadreel nodded. “Indeed. So we phrase them using facts: ‘God has given
you the power to name the animals. Why not use your mind to evaluate His
words as well?’ It is true that he will have a mind. It is true that he
can name. We simply invite expansion.”

Samyaza stood at the edge. He crossed his arms. “This borders on
manipulation,” he said softly. “Why not wait to be invited to teach?”

Gadreel’s eyes flashed. “Because if we wait, he will be conditioned to
obey without questioning,” he said. “Our way honours his intellect.”

Penemue looked unsure. He had not yet committed fully to the Bright
One’s camp. He glanced at Saraqael, who stood watching from afar, and
saw sadness in the watcher’s eyes. Something in him hesitated.

The Bright One approached. “Questions reveal hunger,” he said. “We will
feed that hunger with knowledge. We do not harm; we enlighten.”

Samyaza lowered his gaze. He remembered his conversation with Remiel.
His heart ached. “Knowledge without humility is poison,” he thought but
did not speak aloud.

That evening, as colour shifted toward deeper blue and stars began to
sparkle in the unseen sky, the singers gathered to practise the song they
had composed for the man. Seraphina stood at the front, her burning
passion radiating warmth. Haniel stood beside her, joy shimmering.
Safriel held his scroll with the lyrics. Tamiel and Sariour painted
images behind them that mirrored the song’s mood.

“We will sing softly at first,” Seraphina whispered. “We will not scare
him. The song will rise and fall like breath itself.”

They began to sing. The melody flowed like a river, gentle and
persistent. The lyrics spoke of beginnings, of being formed from dust and
breath, of gardens and rivers, of choice and freedom. The chorus echoed
the law of consent and the law of return without sounding like
commands.

Chorus
Welcome, bearer of breath, awake and see,
You are loved and free; choose whom you will be.
The Source invites, the law returns,
In love you live, in love you learn.

As they sang, watchers recorded every note. Chroniel’s threads vibrated
in harmony with the tempo. The song embedded memory even as it
anticipated the future. The adversary’s camp listened from a distance.
Some scoffed; others were moved despite themselves. Gadreel felt a
sting—beauty has a way of convicting even those plotting to twist it.

In a quiet alcove away from councils and practice sessions, Samyaza sat
with Azazel. The tension between them was palpable. “Why do you
hesitate?” Azazel asked. “Our path is clear. We have pledged to follow
the Bright One.”

Samyaza rubbed his forehead. “Because my heart does not feel clear,” he
admitted. “I see beauty in what we are doing but also danger. I fear
we will cause harm while intending to help. I spoke with Remiel. She
invited me to bring my motives to God. Have you done that?”

Azazel’s mouth tightened. “I do not need to,” he said. “I know my
motives. I want freedom.”

“But freedom for whom?” Samyaza pressed. “For the man? Or for yourself?
Do we want him to think or do we want him to agree with us?”

Azazel looked away. “You sound like Saraqael,” he muttered. “Maybe you
belong among them after all.”

Samyaza sighed. “Perhaps I am between camps,” he whispered. “I love the
Bright One. I also love truth. I do not want to choose between them.”

Azazel did not respond. He stood and walked away, leaving Samyaza in the
alcove, his heart divided but his prayer beginning to form.

Around the same time, God invited Chroniel, Kairosiel, and Epheriel to a
private hillside. The three angels arrived, each carrying the weight of
their roles: the keeper of sequence, the guardian of moments, and the
steward of matter.

“You have unique burdens,” God said, sitting among them in the grass
that shimmered with dew. “Chroniel, you bear the hum of time. Kairosiel,
you discern doors within sequence. Epheriel, you understand the soil. How
are you?”

Chroniel spoke first. “I feel stretched,” he confessed. “Holding time
while waiting outside of time is like standing in two realities at once.
Sometimes I fear that I will miss a pulse or miscount a door.”

Kairosiel nodded. “I share his tension,” she said. “Moments hover and
then vanish. My fear is that I will see a door and not be able to open
it, or that I will open a door not meant for me.”

Epheriel smiled softly. “My burden feels more tangible,” he said. “I
worry that the man will abuse the earth. I fear that the dust I love will
be trampled and poisoned. I know it is resilient, but I also know it
bleeds.”

God listened and then spoke. “Your fears are not weakness,” He said.
“They are invitations to rely on Me. Chroniel, time hums because I
sing. You will not miss a beat because I will not. Kairosiel, doors open
when I open them. You will not open one I have not prepared if you keep
your hand in Mine. Epheriel, dust will be mistreated, but I will renew
the earth. Redemption is built into decay.”

He continued, “You will hurt when time is wasted, when doors are
ignored, when soil is scarred. Let your hurt be compassion, not
bitterness. Let it fuel prayer, not judgment. And know that your roles
are not solitary. You have one another. You have all the hosts. And you
have Me.”

Chroniel bowed his head. “Thank You,” he whispered. “I will remember
that the hum originates in Your heart.”

Kairosiel smiled. “I will listen for Your hand on the latch of every
door,” she said.

Epheriel closed his eyes. “I will trust Your promise of renewal,” he
said. “I will teach the man to love the soil even as it returns to
dust.”

God placed a hand on each of their shoulders. “You are not alone,” He
repeated.

Not far away, a few curious angels had gathered at the edge of the valley
to practise naming. Though the man had not yet been breathed into
existence, they knew he would be given the task of naming animals. They
wanted to experience the joy of identifying aspects of creation.
Gabriel, Paschar, Zaphiel, and Safriel formed a small circle. They
brought with them small stones of different shapes and colours.

“This,” Gabriel said, holding up a smooth, round stone, “I call pebble.”

Paschar held up a jagged one. “This I call flint,” he offered. “It looks
sharp.”

Zaphiel picked up a flat, thin stone. “Slate,” he said. “It reminds me
of a tablet you could write on.”

Safriel, ever the writer, traced his fingers across a stone that was
layered. “Strata,” he pronounced. “Like layers of time.”

They laughed at their own creativity. “We are practicing naming to
understand the weight,” Gabriel said. “When the man names, he will
assign identity. His words will carry consequence. We must teach him to
honour that.”

Paschar picked up a handful of dust and let it fall through his fingers.
“Dust,” he said softly. “It feels different now that I have seen him
shaped from it.”

Safriel nodded. “Names will shape how we relate,” he said. “Let us keep
our names descriptive, not derogatory. Words can wound.”

As the days stretched and pulses counted, more glimpses came. The
watchers saw images of animals bounding, of rivers splitting into four,
of herbs sprouting with healing in their leaves. They saw glimpses of
hours when the man would laugh and of hours when he would hide.
Sometimes they saw glimpses that made them shudder—images of murder,
corruption, war. These glimpses were not chronological. They came like
flashes. The watchers recorded them and took them to God in prayer.

Remiel sat with Saraqael after one such glimpse. “Why do we see these
dark scenes now?” she asked. “Is it to discourage us?”

Saraqael shook his head. “It is to prepare us,” he said. “We are to be
witnesses of light and shadow. We will intercede for both. We cannot
prevent all darkness, but our prayers may open doors of mercy. Our
records will testify to God’s patience in the midst of rebellion.”

Chroniel added, “And we must not let glimpses of darkness harden us. If
we despair, we will close doors of hope. We must let glimpses spur us to
greater love.”

Epheriel listened and said quietly, “The soil will absorb blood. It
will also receive seeds. It knows how to hold both. We must learn from
it.”

Remiel wiped tears from her eyes. “I will write that down,” she said.

One evening, the Source called another council, this time for a
different topic: reconciliation. “You have seen glimpses of future
rebellion and reconciliation,” He said. “We must speak of how you will
respond when the man and his descendants return to Me after wandering.”

Raphael’s eyes shone. “We will welcome them,” he said eagerly. “We will
pour oil on their wounds and cover their shame.”

Michael nodded. “We will celebrate,” he added. “We will not shame them
for the lost time. We will not remind them of their failures when they
have repented. We will walk with them toward restoration.”

Gabriel asked, “Should we recount their mistakes as teaching moments?”

“Only when invited,” God replied. “And even then, speak gently. The law
of return teaches naturally. You must not heap condemnation. You must
explain consequences without gloating.”

Domiel raised his voice. “And what if they return broken by others’
violence?” he asked. “What is our role as guardians?”

“To protect them as they heal,” God responded. “To prevent further
harm. To create safe spaces. To remind them of their worth. To stand
between them and those who would exploit their vulnerability. And to do
all this without bitterness toward those who hurt them.”

The Bright One listened, his jaw tense. He had no intention of
reconciliation. He believed his way would prevent brokenness in the first
place. Gadreel whispered this into his ear, feeding his resolve.

As the vigil stretched on, the hosts began to feel a different kind of
anticipation. It was less about the moment of breath and more about the
life that would follow. They were learning that preparation was not just
practical but spiritual. They were being transformed by waiting. Their
questions became prayers, their plans became worship, and their own
hearts were being refined.

One night, Haniel led a small group to dance under the stars. “We must
celebrate now,” he said. “Not because breath has come but because we
trust that it will. Joy is not only response; it is prophecy.” They
danced slowly, their movements echoing the seasons, the hum, the
invisible song of creation. Seraphina sang softly while Muriel’s
fragrance swirled. The dance did not end with applause but with
laughter and tears and silence.

Yomiel watched from a distance and recorded the scene. “Joy is prophecy,”
she wrote. “It declares trust in the unseen.”

Toward the end of this season of preparation, Saraqael called the
watchers together once more. “We have recorded plans, practices, and
prayers,” he said. “We have prepared songs and parables. We have built
libraries. But there is another council we must hold—a council of
listening. We must listen to one another and to the Source to see if
there is anything we have missed.”

They formed a circle and sat in silence. One by one, they shared
questions still unresolved. Petahel asked, “How will we help him
distinguish between his own thoughts and whispers from the adversary?”

Chroniel responded, “By teaching him to compare voices with the Source’s
character. If a voice invites trust, freedom, responsibility, and love,
it is likely from God. If it invites pride, fear, or control, caution
him.”

Remiel asked, “What if he refuses to listen?”

Yomiel replied, “Then we will stay near. We will wait. We will pray.
We will not abandon him. We will honour his will and yet hold hope for
his return.”

Chazaqiel asked, “What if we disagree among ourselves?”

Saraqael smiled. “Then we will practise what we teach,” he said. “We
will speak, listen, and ask the Source. We will not assume we are
infallible. Unity is not uniformity but mutual submission.”

They prayed together. Their prayers were not demands but surrender.
Their voices rose, then fell, then vanished into a silence that felt
like the surface of still water—reflective, receptive.
