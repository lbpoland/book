Chapter 5 — Work Without Toil

Morning returned with a new purpose. The night had been warm, filled with dreams of gardens within gardens. Adam awoke as Auriel’s blush streaked the horizon. He sat up, the blanket falling from his shoulders, and breathed deeply. He felt his muscles ache lightly from the planting of the day before, a satisfying soreness that reminded him of participation. A faint smell of smoke clung to his hair. Embers from the previous evening’s fire glowed softly; Michael had tended them during the night, stirring them when they threatened to fade, watching the stars and praying silently for strength to protect without controlling.

God was already standing by the river’s edge, looking out over the water, His hands clasped behind His back. He turned as Adam approached. “Are you ready to work with Me today?” He asked, a smile playing at the corners of His mouth.

Adam nodded vigorously. “Yes. I want to plant and water. I want to help the garden.” He touched his belt to ensure the smooth stone from Peliel was still there. Its weight grounded him. He remembered the whisper of the river and the feel of soil under his fingernails.

“Then we begin,” God said. He handed Adam a woven basket lined with leaves. “First, we harvest breakfast. Work begins with receiving.”

They walked toward a patch of low-growing plants with broad leaves and bright red roots just peeking from the soil. “Beets,” God said. “They grow underground. You will pull gently at the leaves. They will come free.”

Adam knelt and grasped the leaves of one plant. He pulled slowly. The root emerged, covered in soil, its colour hidden. He laughed in surprise. “Hidden,” he said. “It hides until I pull.” He placed the beet in the basket. They harvested several more, then moved to another patch where green leaves fanned out from thin white stalks. “Onions,” God said. “These will flavor your food. Their smell will make your eyes water, but they teach perseverance.”

They continued gathering: figs from the lower branches, berries from thornless bushes, tender greens for salad. Adam learned to recognise ripeness by colour and scent. He sniffed, squeezed, and listened to the sound of stems snapping. When his basket was full, he carried it back to the stone circle. Naschiel and Sofiel joined them. Naschiel brought herbs—rosemary, thyme, sage—to season the beets and onions. Sofiel carried a clay pot of olive oil, pressed from fruit that had fallen naturally the day before.

“We will cook together,” Sofiel said, smiling. “Cooking is as much about love as it is about hunger. It blends flavours, invites patience, and creates something new from what was separate.” She showed Adam how to place beets and onions into the hot ash of the fire, covering them with coals. The smell that arose made his stomach grumble. “Hunger is good,” Sofiel said. “It tells you your work matters. It tells you to pause and receive.”

While the food cooked, God led Adam to a clear area near the fig trees. “We will build a trellis,” He said. “Vines need support. If left on the ground, they rot. If given a structure, they climb toward light and bear fruit off the soil. Work sometimes means creating space for others to flourish.”

“How do we build?” Adam asked, examining the pile of thin branches and reeds Gabriel had gathered earlier.

“Watch,” God replied. He took two branches, crossed them, and bound them with a strip of bark. “See how they support each other when joined? Alone, they would fall. Together, they can hold weight.” He secured more branches, forming a frame. Adam mimicked the motion. His fingers fumbled at first, but soon he found the strength and flexibility in the bark. He laughed when his first binding held. “Like we are,” he said. “Together we are stronger.”

“Yes,” God said. “When you tie, you must not strangle. Leave room for movement. The vines will wind through these spaces.”

As they worked, Eariel and Naschiel hummed a low tune to set rhythm. Chroniel walked past, trailing his silver threads. He paused, feeling the pulse of the day quickening. “Remember to breathe with your work,” he murmured. “Inhale as you lift, exhale as you tie. Let your breath guide your pace. If you find yourself holding your breath, slow down.” He touched Adam’s shoulder gently. Adam nodded and tried to coordinate his breath with his movements. He found that his arms felt less tired when he inhaled and exhaled deliberately.

When the trellis stood firm, God and Adam lifted it upright and pressed its legs into the soil. Uriel approached with a vine already crawling across the ground, its tendrils searching for something to climb. They placed the vine at the base of the trellis. “Guide its first reach,” Uriel instructed. Adam gently wound the vine around the lowest branch. It clung, curling its tendril around the wood. “It will find its way now,” Uriel smiled. “Vines teach us that guidance does not stop at initial invitation. They need occasional correction if they wander too far, but they must be allowed to reach on their own.”

Weaving and Craft

After breakfast, Adam and God moved to another area where Choriel and Aspheriel had laid out long grasses and thin reeds. Nearby, Floriel sat among a pile of flowers, weaving their stems into a small wreath, her fingers deft and gentle. “Today,” God said, “you will learn to weave mats. Mats will protect your feet from rocks and thorns. They will create seating places. They will teach you about interweaving lives.”

Choriel handed Adam a bundle of reeds. “These are from the riverbank,” he explained. “They are strong and flexible when wet. If you try to weave them dry, they crack. Timing matters in weaving too.” He dipped the reeds into a shallow pool to soften them. “Watch me.” He crossed three reeds and began to weave a pattern, over and under, over and under, pulling gently, not too tight, leaving enough space for expansion.

Adam mirrored the motion. His first attempts were uneven; some gaps were too wide; some sections were too tight. Choriel laughed kindly. “Do not aim for perfection,” he said. “Aim for presence. Your fingers will learn. See how the reeds want to return to straight? Speak to them with patience. They will bend.”

As they worked, Floriel finished her flower wreath and placed it on Adam’s head. “For focus,” she said. The scent of blossoms enveloped him, calming his frustration at crooked lines. He smiled and continued. Slowly, his weaving improved. After a time, he held a mat that, while imperfect, could hold weight. He placed it under his feet. It felt firm yet yielding. “It works,” he declared proudly.

“It does,” God affirmed. “You have turned raw material into something new. Work transforms. Creation is ongoing. You will find joy in making.”

Floriel handed him another set of reeds. “Would you like to make something for someone else?” she asked.

“Who?” Adam responded.

She looked toward the willow where the Bright One sat, watching them again. “Maybe him,” she said softly. “Perhaps he needs a seat.”

Adam glanced at the Bright One and then back at Floriel. He hesitated, then nodded. “I will weave a seat,” he decided. He worked with more care, imagining the Bright One sitting and feeling comfort. As he wove, he prayed quietly, “Let this show him that work is love.” When he finished, the mat was more even. He carried it over. “For you,” he said, offering it.

The Bright One looked up, surprised. He accepted the mat, his fingers brushing against Adam’s. “Thank you,” he said, his voice almost tender. He placed the mat beside him and sat. “Comfort,” he murmured. “Work serves.” He looked at God across the clearing. “Perhaps you will show him how to weave truth as well as reeds.” The edge of sarcasm in his tone did not go unnoticed.

“Weaving truth takes longer,” God replied calmly. “And it requires more yielding.”

Gardener’s Lesson

With weaving completed, God led Adam to a section of the garden where a variety of plants grew in neat rows: lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, beans. “This part we call the garden’s heart,” God said. “Here you will learn to tend regularly. Plants will not harvest themselves. Weeds will grow. Bugs will come. You will discern which life to nurture and which to remove.”

“What is weed?” Adam asked, kneeling to examine the rows. He saw plants he recognised and others he did not.

“Weeds are plants that threaten what is meant to grow,” God answered. “They are not evil. They have their place elsewhere. But in this space, if left unchecked, they will choke your harvest. You must learn to identify them and pull them gently so that you do not disturb the roots of your crops.”

Raphael approached with a basket and a small wooden tool shaped like a fork. “This will help you loosen the soil,” he instructed. “Slide it under the weed and lift. Do not jerk. The roots can tear and disturb the good plants.”

Adam practised. He knelt, pressed the fork into the soil beside a small plant with long, serrated leaves, and pried. The plant came free with a pop, leaving a small hole. He smelled the roots; they had a sharp, bitter scent. “This is weed?” he asked.

“Yes,” Raphael nodded. “You can tell by the smell and by its desire to take more space than it needs. Weeds often sprawl. They teach us vigilance.”

They worked row by row. Naschiel circled, sniffing the soil and the plants, occasionally pointing out a beneficial herb that looked like a weed but was not. “Do not pull comfrey,” she cautioned. “It will heal wounds. Learn to recognise it by its fuzzy leaves and purple bell-shaped flowers.” Adam touched the leaves of comfrey, committing the texture to memory. He decided to leave it, even if it grew outside the neat row, because it served a purpose.

As midday heat intensified, Chroniel’s threads pulsed with a slower rhythm, reminding them to pause. God led Adam to a small stream and handed him a cup carved from bone. “Drink,” He said. “Rest. Work without rest becomes toil.”

While they rested, Michael approached carrying a tool that looked like a rake. “Tomorrow, I will teach you how to clear larger weeds and stones,” he said. “Guardians must also guard the soil. We protect not only from external harm but from neglect. Neglect invites decay.” He placed the rake down and sat with them. “You do not need to learn everything in one day. We have time.”

Adam nodded gratefully. “Thank you,” he said. “I felt like I had to finish all rows now.”

“Completion can become idolatry,” Michael replied. “Better to work faithfully than to finish quickly.”

Animals as Partners

After rest, God introduced Adam to the idea of partnering with animals in work. They walked to a large meadow where a pair of oxen grazed, their bodies strong and broad, with horns curved gently forward. “These are strong,” God said. “They can pull heavy loads. They can help you till soil that is too hard for your hands alone. But you must treat them with kindness. They will work for you if you invite, not if you force.”

Adam approached cautiously. He placed his hand on one ox’s flank. The animal snorted softly and turned its head toward him. Its eyes were dark and calm. Adam spoke softly. “Hello,” he said. He pressed his forehead to the animal’s forehead. He felt its warm breath. The ox exhaled and relaxed. Adam laughed. “What is your name?”

God whispered, “Wait and listen.” Adam closed his eyes. In the silence, he heard a low sound, like a heartbeat combined with a rumble. “Ox,” he whispered back. The creature seemed to accept. He stroked its neck. “Ox,” he repeated. He felt a resonance in his chest. He looked at God. “It… told me?”

“Creatures reveal names when you listen,” God said. “Animals do not speak as you do, but they communicate. Work with them requires listening. Harnesses are for partnership, not domination.”

Gabriel brought over a simple yoke made of carved wood. It rested on the oxen’s shoulders without cutting. “Let us show you how to place it,” he said. Together, they lifted the yoke onto the oxen. The animals stood still, accustomed to the feeling. God handed Adam a plough—two handles attached to a blade. “Hold,” He instructed. Adam grasped the handles. The wood was smooth but solid.

“When the oxen walk, you walk behind. They will pull. You will guide the blade to cut furrows.” God clicked His tongue and the oxen began to walk forward at a slow pace. The plough’s blade bit into the soil, turning it over, exposing darker earth beneath. Adam felt the resistance and the power combined. He pressed down slightly to deepen the furrow, then lifted to lighten. “It is heavy,” he said through clenched teeth.

“Yes,” God replied. “Work engages your whole body. You will sweat. Sweat is gift; it cools your body. When you toil, you will know the difference. Today, you work with Me and with the oxen. They carry much of the weight.”

They ploughed a long row together. At the end, Adam wiped sweat from his brow. His arms trembled, but his heart was full. He hugged the ox’s neck. “Thank you,” he whispered. He removed the yoke and stroked its back. He looked at the plough marks in the soil. “Straight,” he noted. “Straight like path.”

Uriel smiled. “Paths are furrows turned by obedience and intention,” he said. “Crooked furrows waste seed and water. Straight furrows create fairness. Yet not all rows must be straight. Some will curve around trees. Wisdom discerns when to bend.”

Vocation Explained

As the sun dipped toward afternoon, God and Adam sat beneath a date palm. Ripe dates hung in clusters, their skin translucent gold. God plucked one and handed it to Adam. “Taste.” Adam bit into the date. It was sweet, sticky, rich. He closed his eyes. “Good,” he sighed, licking his fingers.

“You will tend date palms, wheat, barley, olives, grapes, and many more,” God said. “This is your vocation: to serve as steward of this garden, to care for the earth, to name and protect animals, to eat and to share, to harvest and to plant. Vocation is calling, not burden. It is joy that produces fruit outside of yourself.”

“What about rest?” Adam asked. “We worked. We planted. Will we rest every night?”

“Yes,” God nodded. “Rest is part of vocation. Every seventh day, you will rest entirely from work. You will celebrate. You will remember that I provide even when you do not work. This rest is called Sabbath. It is invitation to trust. Work and rest are woven together like reeds, making a mat that holds your life.”

Chroniel stepped closer, his silver threads shimmering. “I will teach you to count days,” he said. “Not to control time, but to honour rhythm. A week is seven pulses. Each seventh pulse is Sabbath. We will sing songs about it. We will not measure to enslave you. We will measure to remind you of rest.”

“Seven,” Adam repeated, tasting the number. “Seven… Sabbath. I like the sound.”

“Numbers carry music,” Chroniel said. “One is beginning, two is relationship, three is stability, four is seasons, five is humanity’s fingers, six is work, seven is rest, eight is new beginning. You will learn their rhythms.”

Adam looked at his hands. He splayed his fingers. “Five,” he murmured. He closed his fist. He opened it again. He laughed. “They are like seeds.”

Baskets and Brewing

Later in the day, Heliel’s light softened. The heat diminished. God led Adam to a spot by the river where reeds grew tall and thick. “We will make baskets,” He said. “Baskets carry. They hold abundance. They teach boundaries in a new way—holding without suffocating.”

Paschar, the young messenger introduced during consent practice, arrived with his own bundle of reeds. He had been practising weaving words into gentle expressions. Now he wanted to learn physical weaving. “May I join?” he asked, excitement in his voice.

“Yes,” God said. “Work with us.”

Choriel and Floriel sat cross-legged on the ground, reeds soaked and ready. Paschar sat, mimicking their posture. God demonstrated the technique: coiling the reed and then binding it with another reed, shaping the basket’s base and then its walls. Adam tried. His coil loosened and threatened to unravel. Paschar laughed and caught it, holding the coil steady. “We help each other,” he said. “You can help me when mine unravels.”

As they wove, they talked about boundaries in baskets. “If the weave is too tight,” Choriel said, “the basket cracks when dry. If it is too loose, the fruit falls through. Boundaries must flex. They must hold and give.”

“Like words,” Paschar added, his messenger training influencing his thought. “If words are too rigid, they become brittle and break hearts. If they are too soft, they fail to hold truth. Speaking is weaving.”

“And like law,” Uriel said from where he polished a spade. “Law must hold us, not choke us. Boundaries must breathe.”

Adam nodded, his hands busy. The basket took shape slowly. He imagined filling it with figs, grapes, and seeds. “One day,” he said, “I will carry food in this and give it to someone else.”

“Generosity is part of vocation,” God affirmed. “Harvest is never for yourself alone. You will eat, and you will also share with Me, with angels, with animals. You will learn to leave some fruit on the tree for birds, some grain in the field for those who wander. Hoarding rots.”

They finished their baskets. Adam’s had a slight lean, but it held together. Paschar’s was tighter but smaller. They laughed and exchanged them as gifts. “Yours will hold my big figs,” Paschar said, handing Adam the smaller basket. “Mine will hold your small berries,” Adam responded, giving him the larger, slightly crooked basket. They both smiled.

Nearby, Sofiel and Muriel prepared a drink from barley and honey. “It will ferment,” Muriel explained. “It will become something different with time. It will taste new. Work takes time; so does transformation. You will learn to wait for certain flavours.” She placed the mixture in a clay jar and covered it. “Time is part of work.”

Discussion on Dominion

As evening approached, God gathered the archangels, guardians, healers, messengers, watchers, and Adam near the river under a large canopy of leaves. The Bright One stood at the edge, listening. “Today,” God said, “you have learned to plant, to weave, to plough, to pull weeds, to harvest, to cook, to partner with animals, to craft. Work is joy. But with joy comes responsibility. I give you dominion over this garden and over the earth. Dominion means stewardship, not exploitation. You will name, nurture, harvest, and protect, but you will not consume without gratitude or harm without need.”

Adam tilted his head. “What is exploit?” he asked.

“Exploitation is taking without giving,” God explained. “It is using strength to serve only self. Dominion invites you to reflect Me—to serve creation as I serve you. You will have authority, but it will be rooted in love. You will decide which trees to prune, which animals to breed, which plants to harvest. You must ask before altering, and you must listen to creation’s response.”

Gabriel stepped forward. “Heaven obeys because of love,” he said. “Creation listens to the Source. You must listen too.”

Michael added, “Dominion is expressed by kneeling before the least, not by standing on them.”

Raphael spoke, “If you injure the earth, your own body will suffer. If you care, your body will flourish. Healing is connected to stewardship.”

Saraqael lifted his pen. “We will record your decisions,” he said. “Not to judge you but to help you remember your intentions when consequences return. Memory will serve you.”

The Bright One raised his hand slightly. “May I speak?” he asked.

God nodded. “You may.”

The Bright One stepped closer. “You speak of dominion as stewardship,” he said. “Yet you withhold knowledge that could make stewardship efficient. You make him ask for every tool. You slow his work with lessons about taste and smell when he could be naming the entire garden. Why delay? Why not grant him complete understanding now so he can rule well from the beginning?”

God met his gaze. “Because ruling without relationship is not stewardship,” He answered. “Because rapid knowledge without character produces tyranny. Because the process of learning shapes the heart. He will know more, but knowing will unfold like seasons. Each lesson builds trust. Without trust, knowledge crushes. You know this, Bright One. You have experienced it.”

The Bright One’s face tightened. “My questions are not rebellion,” he said. “They are concern.”

“I receive your concern,” God replied. “I ask again: do you trust that I give what is needed when it is needed?”

The Bright One looked away. “I trust some,” he said. “I question some.”

“Continue to question,” God said, “but do not let suspicion masquerade as wisdom.”

He turned to Adam. “You will have time to ask Me anything,” He said. “I will answer some now, some later. I will also ask you to wait. Waiting is not withholding love; it is shaping your capacity to receive. Are you willing to wait?”

Adam nodded, though he felt impatience flutter in his chest. “I will try,” he said.

Anticipation of Another

Later, as dusk painted the sky in shades of violet and peach, God and Adam walked along the river. Fireflies began to appear, tiny lanterns bobbing on the air. Adam reached out to gently cup one between his hands. It lit his palms with a soft green glow. He laughed. “Little light,” he whispered. He opened his hands and watched the firefly drift upward.

“Do you still feel the longing?” God asked quietly.

Adam touched his chest. The empty feeling he had identified the evening before still lingered, less sharp but present. “Yes,” he admitted. “It is like… an ache. I like work. I like You. I like them.” He gestured toward the angels scattered along the riverbank. “But there is space here.” He tapped his chest. “A space I cannot fill.”

“That space is preparing you for another,” God said. “It is not deficiency. It is anticipation. It is like soil waiting for seed. You will not plant your longing with forbidden fruit. You will wait. When you receive, you will recognise the gift because you know the ache. Trust Me.”

“I trust,” Adam whispered. “Sometimes trusting feels like hurting.”

God placed His arm around Adam’s shoulders. “Feelings are teachers,” He said. “Hurt can teach dependence; joy can teach gratitude; longing can teach recognition. Do not numb them. Let them instruct.”

The Bright One, hidden among reeds, overheard. He whispered to Gadreel, “Longing is a door. He will step through whatever door relieves his ache. If we present an easier door, he may enter.” Gadreel nodded. Penemue scribbled on a tablet: “Offer ease.” Samyaza overheard and felt his stomach twist. He wrote on his own tablet: “Offer prayer.”

Evening Gathering and Future Tasks

That evening, the hosts gathered around the communal fire. The baskets they had woven were now filled with roasted beets, steamed greens, and honeyed barley. They ate together, hands reaching across the circle to share. Adam felt a sense of family. He chewed slowly, savouring each bite. He watched the Bright One speak quietly to Penemue and Gadreel. He saw Samyaza kneel in prayer. He saw Thaliel weaving another mat, this time with threads of gold from Chroniel’s spool, representing time woven into work.

After the meal, God stood. “Tomorrow,” He said, “we will prune the fig trees. You will learn to cut for growth. You will also learn to listen to animals’ cries. There will be a time when you will need to rescue a lamb trapped in a thicket. You will need to decide whether to leave ninety-nine grazing to save one. Choices will shape you. Work will sometimes interrupt work.” He smiled. “That is good. Life is not linear.”

Raphael added, “Tomorrow I will teach you to identify herbs that stimulate, herbs that calm, herbs that cleanse. Work includes knowing what to apply, what to leave, when to wait.”

Michael spoke, “We will practice lifting stones together. Not because you cannot lift them alone, but because community strengthens and humbles. We will teach you to ask for help.”

Gabriel said, “We will craft more tools. Your hands are strong, but sometimes you will need leverage. I will show you how to shape wood into a handle and stone into a blade.”

Auriel whispered, “We will rise before dawn and watch dawn together again. Patterns anchor.”

Chroniel nodded. “We will count days together. We will mark the first Sabbath soon.”

The Bright One did not speak. He watched and listened. His eyes flickered with thought.

Quiet Voices by the Fire

When most had retired to sleep, a small group remained by the dying embers. Adam sat between Sofiel and Haniel, his head resting against Haniel’s shoulder. Haniel stroked his hair slowly, humming a lullaby that had no words. Sofiel massaged his tired hands with oil. The warmth soothed the ache. He looked up at the stars. “Work is good,” he murmured. “But I am tired.”

“Tiredness is the body asking for rest,” Sofiel said. “Honour it. You have done well.”

Adam’s eyes drooped. He heard faintly the murmur of voices behind him. It was the Bright One and God. He could not make out every word, but he heard enough to know that the conversation continued.

“Why not prepare him for every possible scenario?” the Bright One insisted.

“Because preparation without experience breeds fear,” God answered. “He will meet each scenario as it comes, with Me, with angels, with his own choices. He will build muscles of trust.”

“You call slow instruction love,” the Bright One said. “I call it restraint that may cause harm. If he falls into a pit because he did not know about pits, is that love?”

“I will tell him about pits when it is time to walk near them,” God said. “Your fear of ignorance reveals your own wounds. You strive for control to prevent pain, but you risk creating a different pain—the pain of living without trust.”

The Bright One fell silent. Adam heard only the crackle of embers. He drifted into sleep with the scent of smoke, oil, and herbs filling his senses. His dreams were of weaving reeds into endless mats that stretched across water, linking distant shores.

Dawn of Restlessness

He awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of whispering. The fire had burned down to glowing coals. He saw the silhouettes of Gadreel and Penemue leaning toward the Bright One. “When will we speak to him alone?” Gadreel asked.

“Not yet,” the Bright One replied. “We are watched. We must wait for a moment when his curiosity outweighs his caution. We will ask permission. We cannot influence without invitation.”

“What will you ask?” Penemue pressed.

“We will ask him if he wants to understand why the law exists,” the Bright One answered. “We will ask him if he wants to ensure he never harms anyone. He will say yes. And then we will offer our ‘help’ to interpret.” He chuckled softly. “We will improve his efficiency.”

Adam’s heart pounded. He kept his eyes closed and remained still. He did not understand fully, but he sensed that something important had been said. He felt fear prick at his stomach. He remembered God’s words: tell Me your fears. He whispered within his mind, “I heard them. Help me trust.” Then he slept again.

Sabbath Anticipated

The following day began with the same blush of dawn, but there was a different hum in the air. Chroniel’s threads vibrated with seven pulses, then paused. “Tomorrow,” he announced after breakfast, “we will mark the first Sabbath since your breath. Today we continue work; tomorrow we will rest completely. We will prepare for rest as we prepare for harvest. Rest is not idle; it is active trust. It is letting go of control. It is confession that you cannot sustain the garden alone.”

God looked at Adam. “Sabbath is holy,” He said. “It will remind you that work is not your salvation. It is not your identity. You will cease from sowing, reaping, ploughing, weaving, naming, and even planning. You will enjoy what is given. You will worship. You will be with Me.”

“What if something needs me?” Adam asked. “What if an animal is trapped?”

“Mercy overrides Sabbath,” God replied. “Healing and rescuing are always permitted. Sabbath does not bind love. It binds productivity and control. You will learn to discern.”

Toward the Future

As the day drew to a close, Adam’s hands were stained from figs and dirt. His shoulders ached pleasantly. He had pruned branches under Gabriel’s guidance, pulled out more weeds with Raphael, and lifted stones with Michael and Rivqiel. He had laughed when a lamb got tangled in his newly woven mat and then helped free it, learning to disentangle gently. He had listened to Haniel’s stories about joy and to Muriel’s explanation of fermenting barley. He had felt the threads of Chroniel hum under his feet and learned to step in rhythm. He had glimpsed the Bright One’s brow furrow as God explained that sometimes mercy overrides law but never bypasses trust.

At the evening fire, after another meal, he sat quietly, reflecting. He remembered his first breath, his first word, his first naming, his first planting, his first weaving. He thought about the ache in his chest and God’s promise of another. He thought about the Bright One’s questions and whispers. He thought about tomorrow’s Sabbath. He whispered to God, “I am tired but excited. I trust You. Help me trust.”

God whispered back, “I am here.”

No exile had yet occurred. No serpent had slithered. No separation had been enacted. The garden was full of work that felt like play and rest that would feel like worship. Ideological tension simmered, but no boundary had been crossed. The story remained poised, rich with potential.
