Chapter 8 — The Watcher’s Gaze

Morning in the garden arrived not with fanfare but with the soft pull of light through leaves and the hum of dew evaporating. The air tasted of figs and damp earth. Grass bent gently under the weight of those walking, then sprang back upright, leaving only a lingering scent. From a grove of cedars nearby, a low hum resonated—Chroniel’s threads vibrating with the first pulses of the day. The constellations Asteriel had woven the night before faded one by one as Auriel’s blush washed the eastern sky.

Safriel sat cross-legged beneath a fig tree, his stylus poised above his wax tablet. The lines of his face were softer in the dawn, shadows beneath his eyes betraying a night spent awake. He drew a spiraled fruit with a slash through it, copying Kokabriel’s new boundary symbol from the previous night. Beside him, Yomiel traced an open circle with a dot in the center—desire held by trust. Petahel murmured descriptions under his breath, committing them to memory: “Fingers tense, then relax; eyes lingering on forbidden fruit; joy mixed with restraint.”

Around them, watchers of different ages and temperaments gathered. Saraqael paced slowly along the stream, eyes scanning the horizon. Kokabriel knelt on the moss with ink-stained hands, painting the “Protect” constellation pattern on a piece of bark for later reference. Armaros leaned against a willow, his expression half awe and half sorrow. The hum of Nefeshiel could still be heard from the valley, a reminder of breath given and life sustained.

“It is heavy,” Yomiel said quietly, holding up his tablet. “This symbol—the open circle with the dot—reminds me of the pull I felt when Eve touched the fruit. I wanted to intervene. I wanted to call out, to warn her again. But I held it. My dot trembled.”

Safriel nodded. “My hand trembled too,” he admitted. “Recording a moment when I wanted to speak required a symbol of silence. How do we record our own tension without making ourselves the center? Kokabriel, your fruit with the slash—it is clear. But how do we draw trembling?”

Kokabriel did not look up from his work. “By allowing your stylus to quiver,” he said. “Let the line waver. Do not correct it. The reader will see your hand shake and know that the event shook you. We must not hide our humanity to protect our pride. We must show our reverence and restraint.”

Saraqael stopped pacing and turned toward them. “God did not call us to record as machines,” he said. “Our feelings are part of the record. But they are not the focus. Allow the tremor to show, but do not enlarge it. Do not add commentary about how wise you were to restrain yourself. Let the tremor speak, and let the silence after speak louder.”

“Will we always feel this burden?” Armaros asked, his voice barely above the sound of dew dripping from leaves. “Will there ever be a time when watching becomes easier?”

Saraqael shook his head. “Ease is not our promise,” he replied. “Remember Chroniel’s threads. Each hum is a pulse of sequence, a mercy that allows hearts to grow. Our burden is to witness and to carry memory through those pulses. It will never be easy, but our shoulders will grow stronger. We will learn to sing while we watch.”

As the watchers spoke, footsteps approached. God walked toward them, bare feet damp with dew. His presence brought a calm that settled over the grove like mist. Behind Him came Chroniel and Kairosiel, their hands gently touching the silver threads that hummed. Remiel, the watcher of memory and compassion, followed carrying a bundle of rolled vellum and a small jar of oil.

“Watchers,” God said, His voice like the first note of a song. “Come, let us meet.”

They moved closer, forming a circle. The ground was soft with moss and the scent of cedar filled their nostrils. God sat among them, cross-legged like Safriel. He looked at each of them in turn, His gaze a mixture of tenderness and gravity.

“You have begun to feel the weight of your call,” He said. “Last night you watched your siblings stand before boundaries and choose trust. You saw desire awaken and be restrained. You heard the Bright One question law. You felt your own hearts leap and tremble. Today we will speak about your burden. We will refine your craft. And you will learn that watching is itself an act of love.”

He gestured to Chroniel. The angel of sequence stepped forward and laid the silver threads across the moss in a semicircle. “These threads are humming with time,” Chroniel said. “They mark the rhythm of this day. Hear how each hum is different.” He plucked one thread gently; it vibrated with a low, steady note. He plucked another; it produced a higher tone. “Each event will find its own place along these threads. You cannot force a hum to come sooner or to last longer. Your recordings must align with the hum you feel.”

Remiel knelt and unrolled a piece of vellum. “This is vellum infused with lavender oil,” he explained. “When you write, the oil will release fragrance. As time passes, the scent will fade, marking the difference between your initial feeling and your later reflection. This will teach those who read your record to imagine the freshness of the moment and to see that memory also fades and is renewed. It will remind them to ask again, not to rely only on the first scent.”

“Scent as marker of immediacy,” Safriel murmured, dipping his stylus into the oil. He wrote a line: “Morning dew. Trembling hand. Promise of more.” The fragrance of lavender rose, making his eyes water. He smiled through the tears.

God spoke again. “Today some of you will observe a lamb caught between rocks. You will feel its fear. You will want to pull it free. But I have asked two guardians to watch with you. Peliel will be there. Rahab will roar if danger becomes life-threatening. Your role is to watch and record the lamb’s struggle, the guardians’ response, and your own feelings. You will learn to trust the guardians’ judgment, to wait until life is endangered. This is not to make you callous; it is to teach you that intervention at the wrong moment can harm more than help. Do you consent to this exercise?”

The watchers exchanged glances. Saraqael’s brow furrowed. Safriel bit his lip. Yomiel nodded slowly. One by one, they murmured “Yes,” though some voices shook.

“Good,” God said. “Afterwards, we will gather to share what you saw and felt. Remember, you are not alone.”

The group dispersed. Chroniel and Kairosiel remained, their fingers continuing to stroke the silver threads, adjusting their positions subtly as if aligning the day itself. God walked with Saraqael a short distance. “Your heart is heavy,” He said.

Saraqael nodded. “I feel like a guard dog chained, watching danger but unable to bark,” he admitted. “I trust You. But my body wants to move.”

God placed a hand on his shoulder. “Your desire to protect is good,” He said. “But you are not to replace My timing. Feel the tension. Let it fuel your prayer. Offer your discomfort as intercession. Your restraint is a form of obedience that shapes the world just as much as action.”

Training at the Ravine

Later that morning, the watchers gathered at the edge of a ravine where a small stream tumbled over rocks. The sun warmed their shoulders. The scent of wet stone and lichen filled their lungs. Peliel stood on a boulder midstream, arms folded, his long hair blown by the water’s spray. Rahab sat nearby, his body curled like a lion at rest, but his eyes alert and golden. His deep hum vibrated the stones.

A lamb had wandered near the edge, tempted by a clump of clover that grew between two rocks. Its hooves slipped. It slid, legs flailing, and caught itself on a narrow ledge. It bleated, eyes wide with panic. Its mother bleated back from above, pacing along the ravine’s edge.

Safriel’s hand tightened around his stylus. Yomiel’s breath hitched. Armaros whispered a prayer under his breath. They all felt the urge to rush forward, to lift the lamb. But they had agreed to trust the guardians.

Peliel raised his hand. “Wait,” he said quietly, though his voice carried over the water. He watched the lamb carefully. The lamb scrambled, pushing with hind legs. Its front hooves found a purchase. It bleated again, softer. It paused. Then, slowly, it climbed back onto the slope. The watchers exhaled.

“It needed to learn that footing matters,” Peliel said. “If I had lifted it too soon, it would not remember the danger next time. Its mother’s call guided it, and it listened. My hands were ready to catch it if it slipped further. Rahab was ready to roar if danger escalated. Love is not only the act of rescue; it is also the wisdom to let strength develop.”

Rahab rumbled softly. “My roar is love,” he said. “Not all roars are the same. Some warn. Some gather. Some rebuke. Today you heard a roar withheld. It is as important to know when to hold silence as when to use voice.”

Safriel wrote, his stylus leaving a faint tremor mark when the lamb slipped: “Lamb slipping. Heart beating. Peliel’s hand raised. Not yet. Lamb climbs. Relief. Lesson learned.” He then drew a small wave line above the word “not yet” to indicate tension.

Saraqael, who had stood slightly apart, closed his eyes. He whispered, “Strength grows when boundaries are honoured.” He felt his own heart’s boundary between intervention and trust strengthening. He saw in his mind’s eye the watchers on future days when the pull to intervene would be overwhelming. He prayed for courage to wait.

After the exercise, the watchers gathered in a circle. “How did you feel?” Remiel asked, his voice gentle.

“My stomach hurt,” Yomiel admitted. “It still hurts. I see that the lamb is safe. I understand why we waited. But my body… It wanted to jump.”

“You must speak to your body as you speak to your mind,” Remiel said. “Tell your muscles, ‘I trust the guardian.’ Place your hand on your chest and breathe. Your body will learn to align with your trust.” He demonstrated, pressing a hand to his own chest and inhaling deeply. The watchers imitated him. Their breaths synced with Nefeshiel’s hum. Slowly, their tension eased.

Armaros wiped tears from his eyes. “I felt anger at the boundary,” he confessed. “At first I thought, ‘Why did God not make the ground smooth here? Why allow such danger?’ But as the lamb climbed, I saw it shake and then stand taller. I realised the rocks are teachers. They will keep the lamb from wandering too close again. The boundary protects without confining.” He drew a small rock on his tablet with ripples around it.

“Your anger turned into gratitude,” Saraqael observed.

“Yes,” Armaros said. “And I see my anger in other areas may turn similarly if I watch.”

A Meeting Under the Olive Tree

As the sun climbed higher, God led a group of watchers to a large olive tree near the center of the garden. The tree’s twisted trunk was thick with knots, its branches heavy with green and purple fruit. Oil dripped from some olives, and the ground smelled rich. Bees buzzed, their hum joining the song of the threads.

Chroniel and Kairosiel sat to one side, their hands still on the threads. Safriel, Saraqael, Yomiel, Kokabriel, Petahel, Armaros, Remiel, and a few younger watchers like Shomeriel were present. The Bright One was also there, leaning against the tree’s trunk, his face in shadow. Gadreel, Penemue, and Samyaza stood nearby, quills at the ready. Thaliel sat cross-legged near Safriel, her eyes closed in prayer.

God began. “Watchers,” He said, “you carry a burden that no other order carries. You see beyond the moment. You preserve what happened without adding what did not. You will witness choices that make you weep. You will see harm. You will feel the pull to intervene. But you must honour consent. You may not impose your will, even to prevent suffering. The only exception is when harm threatens life that cannot choose, and a guardian has not intervened. Even then, you act through guardians, not on your own. Do you understand?”

Safriel nodded. Yomiel whispered, “We understand.”

God continued, “You will also see glimpses of what may come. Dreams, visions, and echoes of future choices will be given to you. These are not scripts to control events; they are invitations to prayer. They will teach you to intercede without manipulation. You will feel the weight of time before others do. Use this knowledge to serve, not to command.”

“What do we do with glimpses?” Petahel asked. “If we see a branch break in a vision, do we warn the one who will walk under that tree?”

“If you are invited into conversation with them, you may share your vision as an invitation to ask Me,” God replied. “But do not speak as if it is inevitable. Do not frighten them. Ask, ‘May I tell you what I saw?’ Then invite them to seek Me. Visions can become idols if they replace relationship. They are not given for control but for compassion.”

The Bright One shifted against the trunk. “And if a vision reveals pain that cannot be avoided?” he asked, his tone measured.

God’s gaze rested on him. “Then it reveals pain,” He said simply. “I give glimpses to prepare hearts, not to give permission to intervene against law. Pain is not always harm. Pain can be teacher. Your compassion must align with My wisdom.”

The Bright One’s jaw tightened. “And if compassion drives us to share knowledge early?” he pressed. “If we foresee their future sorrow, are we not cruel to allow them to walk into it blindly?”

“Knowledge cannot replace trust,” God answered. “If you share knowledge prematurely, you risk cutting them off from relationship. They will rely on your information rather than on Me. They will view law as restriction rather than guidance. They must choose. Your compassion must be tethered to love, not fear.”

Gadreel scribbled this exchange, noting the tone of both voices: God’s calm, the Bright One’s tension. Penemue’s eyes darted between them, his quill poised but not moving.

Samyaza lifted his hand. “May I speak?” he asked. God nodded. “I know we are watchers,” Samyaza said, “and I do not desire to control. But sometimes our own questions swirl. Our curiosity itself needs an outlet. May we come to You with our questions, even the ones that feel rebellious?”

“Always,” God said firmly. “You may ask Me anything. Bring your frustration, your doubt, your anger, your desire. I do not fear your questions. I ask only that you come with open hands, willing to hear My response. Ask not to justify your desires but to understand My heart. Ask from relationship, not from suspicion.”

Thaliel opened her eyes. “I have asked many questions,” she said, her voice soft. “And each time, Your response has drawn me closer. My questions have become prayers. I want that for my siblings. Even for those who lean toward suspicion.” She glanced at the Bright One, then at Gadreel and Penemue.

The Bright One met her gaze briefly. Something flickered across his face—guilt or regret—but then it was gone. He looked away toward the tree’s distant branches.

Adam and Eve Among the Vines

While the watchers met under the olive tree, Adam and Eve walked through rows of grapevines. Their arms brushed leaves heavy with fruit. The air was warm, insects buzzed, and the ground between the rows was soft with tilled soil. Zamar trotted beside them, his long neck weaving in and out of the vines. Kangar hopped ahead, occasionally turning his head to see if they followed. Bea walked behind, her tail sweeping the dust. The ox grazed along the edges, his horns catching in the vines and shaking them gently, sending a rain of dewdrops onto Eve’s hair.

“Look,” Eve whispered, pointing to a spider web stretched between two vines. The web shimmered with dew. In its center, a small brown spider worked, weaving threads with precision. The pattern resembled the open circle with the dot that Yomiel had drawn that morning, but each thread was anchored in several places. Eve drew closer, her breath stirring the web. The spider paused, sensing the movement. It remained still until her breath calmed, then continued weaving.

“It listens,” Adam said. He watched the spider attach a thread and pull it taut. “It waits for the right tension. It does not rush.”

“Like us with boundaries,” Eve replied. She reached out but stopped her hand just short of the web. “May I watch you work?” she whispered to the spider. She waited, not expecting an answer, but feeling the invitation to respect even a tiny creature’s space. The spider continued weaving. Eve smiled and lowered her hand. “It said yes,” she announced. “It kept weaving.”

Adam laughed. “I am learning that all creation consents in its own way,” he said. “Rocks do not object when we sit on them, but they speak when we strike them. Water invites our hands but pushes if we dive into a current without asking Peliel. Even vines whisper when they’ve had enough fruit taken.” He gently touched a cluster of grapes, then withdrew his hand when he sensed the vine’s energy waver. “Not yet ripe,” he said.

Zamar hummed and lowered his head to sniff the grapes. He looked at Adam, waiting. “You want to taste?” Adam asked. Zamar pushed his nose forward. “May I pick one for you?” Adam asked the vine. He waited. The vine’s leaves rustled gently, as if shifting. Adam sensed peace. He plucked a grape and fed it to Zamar. Zamar’s eyes brightened, and he hummed in delight. The watchers, following at a distance, noted this exchange: Safriel wrote, “Consent conversation with vine and animal.” He drew a small cluster of grapes with two lines: one between the vine and Adam, another between Adam and Zamar.

Eve touched a vine, feeling the roughness of its bark. “This vine holds onto the trellis like I hold onto your arm when crossing water,” she said. “It climbs, but it also needs support. Its fruit hangs between strength and trust.”

“Like us,” Adam replied. “We stand strong, but we lean on God’s voice, on each other, on boundaries. Without them, we fall.”

They walked deeper into the vineyard. At the far end, near a grove of willows, a shimmering shape moved among the roots. It was long and sinuous, scales catching light in iridescent patterns: blues, greens, golds. It slithered with grace, its head lifted slightly, its eyes bright and watchful. A flickering tongue tasted the air. It was a creature unlike any they had yet seen. Some watchers saw it earlier in dreams, but never in waking. As it moved, its scales sounded faintly like whispers: words just beyond comprehension.

Yomiel’s breath caught. He nudged Safriel and pointed. Safriel’s eyes widened. He drew the creature’s outline quickly: long body, tapered head, scales patterned like starlight on water. He left the lines open at the tail, uncertain how long it would be. He drew wavy lines around its head to mark the shimmer. He whispered, “A new creature.”

Kokabriel leaned forward, his quill ready. “What does it say?” he asked softly.

Petahel closed his eyes and listened. The whispers were faint but distinct. He heard phrases, echoes of questions from the night before, but rearranged: “Why wait?” “What is death?” “Improvement or control?” The words were not spoken aloud. They were suggestions carried on scales.

“It speaks in questions,” Yomiel murmured. “Questions we have asked. Questions we fear.”

Saraqael narrowed his eyes. He wanted to step closer, but something held him back. A boundary not of thorns or river, but of purpose. He remembered God’s words: “Observe. Do not intervene. Wait.” He clenched his fists and breathed.

Adam and Eve had not yet noticed the creature. They were focused on a set of vines that had twisted around a willow trunk, forming a natural arch. Eve ran her fingers along the willow’s bark. “This tree weeps,” she said. “Its branches hang like tears. But its leaves feel soft. Sorrow can be gentle.”

From his position, the Bright One watched the shimmering creature too. His eyes followed the play of light on scales. He recognized the potential. He felt something stir within him: admiration and envy. A creature with the ability to wind around branches, to move unseen, to listen and then speak into ears near the ground. He thought of how he might use such form. He thought of the questions he and Gadreel had rehearsed. He looked at his own hands, then at the creature. A slow smile touched his lips. He made a note in his mind: “Flexible, silent, close to the ground.”

Penemue leaned toward him. “It is beautiful,” he whispered. “It can move without being seen by those who do not look down.”

“And it hears what is spoken in whispers,” the Bright One murmured. “Its ears are on its body. It feels vibrations. It will be perfect.”

Samyaza listened, his face pale. He looked at Thaliel. She returned his gaze with eyes full of pleading. “Do not,” she mouthed. He swallowed and looked away.

Whispers in the Whispering Grass

Later, as the sun slid toward late afternoon and shadows lengthened, the watchers regrouped at the Library of Sequence. This library was not a building but an open area under a canopy of oak trees. Shelves carved from living branches held wax tablets, rolled parchments, pieces of bark, woven tapestries, jars of scented oils, and piles of smooth stones. The air smelled of ink, beeswax, lavender, and rosemary. Breezes rustled leaves overhead, their susurration like a constant reading of pages.

Safriel approached a table where blank wax tablets awaited. He placed his morning tablet down and retrieved a fresh one. His hands shook slightly as he recorded the shimmering creature: “A being like a river of scales, shimmering like dawn on water. It glides without sound. It tasted the air with its tongue. It whispered questions not spoken. It looked at me as if it knew I recorded it.” He drew a series of spirals around the creature to indicate the whispers, each spiral anchored to the body by a thin line.

Kokabriel placed a small jar of crushed carnelian powder on the table. “Use this colour for this creature,” he said. “Carnelian burns like sunset. It will mark the danger hidden in beauty.” He dipped a brush in oil, then tapped the powder, and gently brushed it along the scales of the drawing. The red shimmered against the dark wax. A scent of spice rose: cinnamon and something sharper. Safriel breathed it in and felt his heartbeat quicken.

Saraqael looked over his shoulder. “What will we call it?” he asked quietly.

“We will not name it yet,” Kokabriel replied. “We record without naming. Names confer authority. We must wait until the human names it, or until God names it, if it is to be named at all.”

Remiel approached with a bowl of water. “Wash your hands and your hearts,” he said. “You have seen something you do not understand. Do not let fear colour your record. When you are ready, share your feelings with one another.”

They did. Yomiel admitted his fear. Safriel admitted his fascination. Petahel confessed a mixture of dread and curiosity. Armaros said nothing but placed his palm on the bowl’s surface, then touched his forehead, a sign of humility. Shomeriel, the young watcher aligned with the adversary, whispered to Penemue, “It is beautiful. Could something beautiful be dangerous?” Penemue’s eyes flickered but he did not answer.

The Bright One’s Planning

At a secluded grove on the garden’s edge, the Bright One gathered his followers that evening. Gadreel, Penemue, Samyaza, Thaliel, Shomeriel, and a handful of others sat in a semicircle on grass. Fireflies glowed in the canopy, casting points of light over their faces. The river’s murmur could be heard in the distance. The scent of lemon balm and rosemary drifted from Naschiel’s herb patch.

“You saw the new creature,” the Bright One said. “You heard its whispers. Its form speaks of subtlety. Its movement invites listening. I believe it can be used to bring a question to our siblings without causing alarm.”

Gadreel nodded. “Questions are seeds,” he said. “If we plant them carefully, they grow into ideas. We must choose the first seed with precision.”

“We will approach the woman,” the Bright One continued. “She is curious and perceptive. She appreciates beauty and scent. She asked about the tree before the man. She tasted the vine’s fruit after asking. She is thoughtful. She will respond to nuance.”

Penemue’s brow furrowed. “Will we speak truth or twist it?” he asked. “I do not want to lie.”

“We will not lie,” the Bright One said quickly. “We will frame the truth differently. We will ask, ‘Did God really say you may not eat from any tree?’ She will correct us. She will speak truth. Then we will present knowledge as invitation. We will say, ‘You will not die. You will be like God, knowing good and evil.’ That is true. Their eyes will open. We will not force them. We will simply offer a perspective that emphasizes potential over prohibition. We will respect consent. They must choose to invite our words.”

Samyaza shifted uneasily. “The phrasing matters,” he said. “Questions that begin with ‘Did God really…’ carry suspicion. They imply that God might not be trustworthy. Is that the intent?”

The Bright One’s lips pressed into a line. “The intent is to invite them to consider that there may be other ways to interpret His words,” he said. “It is to awaken ambition. They are image-bearers. They are meant to grow. We will not coerce. We will encourage them to step into their fullness sooner.”

Thaliel shook her head. “Encouraging them to step before time is not love,” she whispered. “It is pushing them toward harm. You speak of potential, but you avoid the cost. Knowledge without trust will crush them. You saw their faces when they touched the fruit. Their hearts trembled. They need time.”

The Bright One’s gaze hardened. “Time is a resource,” he snapped softly. “Too much time breeds complacency. They will stagnate. We can help them. If they know what knowledge is withheld, they will strive to be like Him sooner. They will become strong. They will not stumble as we did. We can correct inefficiency.”

Gadreel whispered, “We can save them from pain.”

Samyaza closed his eyes, murmured a prayer under his breath, and said, “We cannot save them by undermining trust. We can only accompany them. We are watchers, not authors.” He looked at Penemue, then at Thaliel. “We must decide if our actions align with love. If not, we must not proceed.”

Thaliel’s eyes filled with tears. “We cannot decide for them,” she said. “We can only decide for ourselves. I choose to pray. I choose to trust God’s timing.” She stood and walked away from the group, her wings trailing dew. She headed toward the Library of Sequence to sit with Remiel.

The Bright One watched her go, his expression unreadable. “She weakens,” he said softly. “We will proceed without her.”

Samyaza hesitated. Gadreel looked at him. Penemue looked at the ground. Shomeriel’s face lit up with curiosity. “When?” she asked.

“Soon,” the Bright One replied. “We will wait for the right time—when she is alone and curious. We will ask the first question then.”

Whispers to the Spirit

That night, after the watchers and guardians retired to their places of rest, Safriel remained at the Library of Sequence. He lit a small lamp made of clay and filled with olive oil. The flame flickered, casting warm light on the scrolls and tablets. He opened a new parchment, dipped his quill into ink infused with neroli, and began to write a prayer.

“Spirit,” he wrote, “You who hover over the waters, who whisper to hearts, who comfort the weary, hear my plea. We are watchers. We see the seeds of dissent. We feel the pull of curiosity untethered. We sense the weight of the first question. Our hands tremble. Our hearts race. Teach us to watch with love, to record without bitterness, to pray without forcing Your hand. Hold us when we want to intervene. Guide us when we speak. Strengthen us when we record tears. Help us to trust Your timing. Amen.”

He finished and blew gently on the ink to dry it. The scent of neroli filled the air, reminding him of the woman’s creation. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. He heard Chroniel’s threads humming quietly. He heard Nefeshiel’s distant hum. He heard, faintly, the whispers of scales on leaves near the tree. He prayed again.

Closing Scene: Watchers Beneath the Stars

Later that night, the watchers lay on their backs in a field of tall grass near the fig grove. Stars spanned the sky, shimmering like spilled water. Asteriel moved among them, adjusting constellations, adding a small star to the “Protect” pattern and naming it “Watch.”

“This star,” he said softly, “will remind you that watching is itself protection. You protect by witnessing, by recording, by praying. You guard memory. You keep the story true.”

Safriel looked at the new star. He felt the weight of his task but also a flicker of joy. He whispered to Yomiel, “We will carry this. Together.”

Yomiel nodded. “Together,” he echoed. He reached out and took Safriel’s hand. Others joined, linking hands across the grass. Their fingers intertwined like woven reeds. Their hearts beat in unison with Chroniel’s threads. Their eyes watched the star “Watch,” letting its light seep into their bones.

In the shadows at the edge of the field, the Bright One watched them. He folded his arms across his chest. He looked at the star Asteriel had placed and then at the shimmering creature coiled near the tree. He whispered, “Soon.”
