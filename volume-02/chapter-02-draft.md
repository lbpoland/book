Chapter 2 — Eyes Opened
Dawn and Dream

Adam slept, enveloped by night’s hum and Haniel’s gentle song. In the hours after the sun sank beneath the mountains and Luniel rose, his mind wandered in patterns that were not fully under his control. Dreams flowed like streams through his consciousness. He saw images that he had not yet encountered while awake: a vast field of golden grain bending in wind he had not felt; a figure walking beside him with a hand that felt like his but smaller; a serpent shimmering like wet stone, speaking without moving its mouth, its words indistinct and tugging; a tree with fruit shining, leaves rustling with laughter and warning. None of these images came with explanation. They simply moved through him and then receded. When he stirred as the first blush of Auriel’s dawn touched the horizon, he did not hold onto the images like possessions. They lingered like scent, not like law.

God sat beside him, having watched over his sleep. As dawn’s light moved across the valley, painting leaves with pink and gold, God whispered, “Good morning, Adam.” The words were both greeting and blessing. Adam opened his eyes at the word “morning” and found that his lids were heavier than he expected. He rubbed them with the back of his hands and blinked.

“I saw … pictures,” Adam said, propping himself onto his elbows. “My eyes were closed, but I saw. Is that normal? Are my eyes open when I sleep?”

“Those are called dreams,” God answered. “They happen when you sleep. Dreams can be invitations, warnings, comforts, or simply reflections of your heart processing what you have experienced and what is to come. They are not commands. Do not interpret dreams as if they are my voice unless I confirm through other means. We will talk about each if you wish.”

Adam thought about the small hand in his dream. It warmed him. “There was someone who felt like me,” he said softly. “Another like me.”

God smiled, knowing the significance. “You are not meant to be alone. But today is still about seeing. Trust the unfolding.”

Adam nodded, though a yearning had already been planted. He stretched, feeling the length of his limbs. He yawned and then laughed at the involuntary nature of it. “My muscles feel tight,” he observed.

“That is called stiffness,” Raphael said, stepping closer. “It happens after you have lain still for a while. Movement will warm your muscles again. Stretch. Reach. Breathe.”

Adam stood and reached his arms toward the sky. He bent and touched his toes, feeling the pull along the backs of his legs. He twisted and felt his spine pop gently. It felt good. He exhaled a sigh of satisfaction and looked toward the horizon.

The Curtain of Light

Auriel approached, her presence like the blush of the sky. “May I introduce you to dawn?” she asked. Adam smiled and nodded. “Watch,” she said, pointing to the line where earth and sky met. Adam watched as the darkness lightened by degrees. Bands of color appeared—deep blue turning lighter, then a soft pink, then orange. The sun edged into view, and golden light spilled across the landscape, illuminating the leaves, the rocks, the stream.

“Beautiful,” Adam whispered, his hand instinctively going to his chest. He felt his heart quicken slightly at the sight. “It makes me feel awake.”

“That is one of its purposes,” Auriel said. “Dawn announces the end of night and invites you to rise. It teaches hope. Even after darkness, light returns. Do not worship light, but learn from it.”

Adam nodded. He raised his palm and shielded his eyes. “It is bright,” he said, squinting.

Heliel, guardian of the sun, laughed. “The sun is strong. It will teach you to cover your eyes and to seek shade when its heat is intense. Your eyelids and brows will protect you. Use your hands to shade. Do not stare at it directly for long. Light can nourish but also overwhelm.”

“I feel warmth on my skin,” Adam said, lowering his hand and exposing his arm to the sun. “It is pleasant.”

“Heat helps plants grow and warms your body,” God explained. “But you will learn to balance heat and cool. Too much heat burns; too little chills. Balance is part of wisdom.”

Hearing and Smell

“You have listened and tasted,” God said, “but today you will become aware of hearing and smell more deeply.”

Eariel, the angel of hearing, stepped forward. His entire form seemed to be made of waves—rippled like sound across water. “Sound is vibration,” he said. “You hear because your ears receive waves. Hearing invites you to attend to the world. It is a gift that must be used with discernment. Not everything you can hear is meant to be consumed. Not all words should be repeated. Listen with your heart as well as your ears.”

Adam touched his ears. They were soft and curved, with ridges that guided sound. He had touched them before, but now he noticed how they directed waves inward. “I hear the stream,” he said. “It is like laughter. I hear birds.” He paused. “There are so many kinds of bird songs. Some high, some deep. They say … something?”

“They speak bird,” Eariel chuckled. “They praise, warn, call. You may not understand their tongue, but you will feel their mood. Listen. The warbler’s song invites joy. The dove’s call invites peace. The crow’s cry warns.”

Adam closed his eyes and listened. He heard layers of sound: water over stone, leaves rustling, insects humming, birds singing, the distant roar of a waterfall. He heard the soft footsteps of angels moving, the whisper of wings, the heartbeat in his own chest, his breath moving in and out. He opened his eyes, tears forming again. “It is like … the world speaks,” he murmured.

“Creation speaks,” God agreed. “It speaks of my glory. It invites you to join in praise. You will also need quiet to hear me. Noise is not always helpful. Learn to listen to silence as well.”

Naschiel, the angel of smell, approached next. She held in her hands a bundle of herbs and flowers—lavender, mint, jasmine, rosemary. “Smell is connected to memory,” she said. “When you breathe in through your nose, you receive molecules that carry the essence of what you smell. They lodge in your mind and heart. Fragrance can comfort, warn, invigorate. It can bring back moments you thought forgotten.” She crushed a mint leaf between her fingers and held it under Adam’s nose.

Adam inhaled. The scent was sharp and sweet, clearing his mind. “It feels like a cool breeze inside my head,” he laughed. “It makes my mouth water.”

“Mint will refresh you when you are weary,” Naschiel said. She then took a sprig of jasmine and let its sweet perfume rise. “This scent soothes. It will remind you of evenings and peace.”

Adam breathed it in and felt his shoulders loosen. “It is like a blanket,” he said.

Naschiel smiled. “Pay attention to smell. It will teach you about time. Some scents only come at night. Others come before rain. Some will warn you of spoilage. Some will call you to remembrance.”

Watchers dipped quills into oils, pressing them onto their scrolls to capture these scents. They murmured about how to describe the way smell and sound made them feel without making the record about themselves.

Reflection in Water

God led Adam to a still pool. “Look,” He said, kneeling beside it. “What do you see?”

Adam knelt and looked into the water. For the first time he saw his own face. He blinked at the stranger staring back. His eyes were wide and brown, his nose straight, his lips full, his hair thick and curling around his head. He touched his cheek and watched the reflection mirror him. He stuck out his tongue and laughed when the image did the same. “That is me,” he said in wonder. “I have a face like yours and yet different. My skin is darker than yours. My eyes … I can see my own eyes looking at me.”

“This is your reflection,” God explained. “Water will mirror you. You will see yourself when you look. It can remind you of your appearance, but it cannot tell you who you are. Do not let your worth be determined by reflection alone. Let relationship define you.”

Adam nodded. “I like my face,” he said with childlike honesty. “It is … strong?”

“And kind,” God added. “You will learn to see character reflected not only in flesh but in actions. Beauty is truth lived, not surface alone.”

Adam’s brows furrowed. He dipped his hand into the water and watched ripples distort his reflection. “It changes,” he observed. “If I move, my face disappears.”

“Words can do that too,” God said softly. “Careless speech can distort truth. But if you are still, clarity returns.”

Touching and Being Touched

As the day warmed, animals approached. A young deer, its fur dappled, stepped cautiously toward Adam. It sniffed the air, ears flicking. Adam held out his hand slowly, palm up. He remembered to ask, “May I?” He looked at the deer, and though the animal could not speak, it did not flinch. It sniffed his hand and then nudged his fingers with its nose.

The sensation was soft and ticklish. Adam laughed. “It feels like grass,” he said. He reached out and stroked the deer’s neck, feeling the warmth of its body, the texture of the fur. The deer’s muscles tensed briefly and then relaxed under his touch. It nuzzled his shoulder and then bounded away.

“It trusted you,” Michael observed. “Gentleness invites trust. Force drives away.”

Adam nodded, understanding a deeper law without naming it. He knelt and touched the ground. He let soil slip through his fingers, noticing its coolness, its grit. He picked up a smooth stone and ran his thumb along its surface. He touched the bark of a tree and felt the rough ridges. He stroked a leaf and marvelled at its delicate veins. “Everything feels different,” he said, eyes alight. “Even one thing has many textures. The bark is rough, but the leaf is smooth. The stone is hard, but the moss is soft.”

“Texture teaches you to differentiate,” Haptiel said. “You will learn to build with hard things, rest on soft things, avoid rough things when they are harmful. Touch is counsel. Listen to it.”

A Fall and a Lesson

Later, while exploring a slope, Adam placed his foot on a wet patch of moss. His foot slipped. He fell, sliding down the small hill on his side. He cried out as rocks scraped his skin. He came to rest at the bottom, pain blooming across his arm and hip. He lay there, breath knocked out of him, eyes wide. He felt heat in his wounds and saw blood for the first time—bright red lines on his skin where stones had grazed.

Raphael approached quickly, kneeling beside him. “Are you all right?” he asked gently.

Adam’s eyes filled with tears. “It hurts,” he said, biting his lip to keep from crying out again. “My skin … it is open. Red is coming out.”

“That is blood,” Haemiel said calmly. “Blood flows through your body. When your skin breaks, it comes out to clean the wound and then clot to stop the bleeding.”

“It is scary,” Adam whispered, pressing his hand over the scrape.

“Hurt is not the same as harm,” Raphael explained. “This scrape will heal. Pain tells you something has happened that needs attention. Listen to it, but do not let it master you. May I touch you to help?”

Adam nodded, giving consent. Raphael placed his hands gently over the wound. Warmth flowed. The bleeding slowed. The torn skin began to knit, leaving a thin line that would fade with time. The pain lessened, though a dull ache remained as a reminder. Adam sighed in relief. “Thank you,” he said.

“You are welcome,” Raphael replied. “You will learn to treat small injuries yourself with herbs. Do not fear pain. It will teach you caution.”

Michael offered his hand to help Adam stand. “Balance is learned,” he said. “Falling teaches you to be attentive. It also teaches humility.”

Adam looked at the hill. “I did not see the moss,” he said.

“Seeing is not only with eyes,” God reminded him. “It is with attention. You will learn to be present.”

Colours and Names

As afternoon light filtered through the canopy, Uriel brought a basket of stones and pigments gathered from the earth: red ochre, yellow clay, green malachite, blue azurite. “Colour is language,” he said. “You will see colours that stir feelings. Use them to describe. Use them to paint. Use them to name.”

He spread the pigments on a flat stone, mixing each with a little water to reveal their hues. Adam dipped his finger into the red and then rubbed it on his skin. The contrast between the red and his brown skin fascinated him. “Red,” he said, grinning. He dipped his finger in the green and smeared a streak on the rock. “Green.” He looked at the blue. It reminded him of the sky. “Sky,” he said, pointing. Uriel nodded, smiling.

“You will give colours names too,” Uriel said. “Some you will call for what they remind you of—sky, blood, leaf. Some you will name for the way they make you feel. Colours can describe mood. They can warn, soothe, excite. Use them wisely.”

Watchers recorded the moment as Adam’s first intentional naming act. They drew circles filled with the pigments and wrote the syllables he uttered. Safriel hummed a melody in which each colour corresponded to a note, planning to create a song that would help future children remember colours.

A New Instrument: Echoes

As they walked along a cliff edge, God cupped His hands around His mouth and called, “Adam!” The sound bounced off the rock face and returned as a faint repetition: “Adam, Adam.” Adam’s eyes widened. “It repeats!” he exclaimed.

“That is called an echo,” Eariel said. “Sound waves bounce and come back. Echoes teach you about space. They also teach you about words returning. When you speak, your words will echo in others. They will come back to you as consequences and memories. Choose words with care.”

Adam tried it. He shouted, “Hello!” The word returned: “Hello … lo … lo.” He laughed. “Hello to you too!”

God laughed with him. “Play is part of learning. Joy is a teacher.”

The Adversary Plots with Vision

In the dimmer realm, Gadreel and Penemue practised crafting questions that would entice by focusing on sight. “We will appeal to what he sees,” Gadreel explained. “He will see the tree and its fruit. We will describe it as desirable to make one wise. We will not lie. It is beautiful. We will suggest that beauty alone indicates permission.”

Penemue nodded. “We can also frame God’s boundaries as withholding. ‘Did God really say you cannot eat from any tree?’ The question invites clarification but drips with implication.”

Samyaza rubbed his forehead. “We must be careful. If we state something untrue, it will violate the law. We must let them come to the conclusion themselves.”

Thaliel, whose heart was growing heavy with the path he had chosen, whispered, “It does not feel right, twisting curiosity.”

“Curiosity is neutral,” Gadreel snapped. “We simply guide it. We cannot force. We only persuade. If they fall, it will be because they choose.”

Thaliel looked away, his conscience stirring. He pictured Adam’s eyes open wide with wonder and felt a pang. He thought of the council of voices and the instruction that stories must invite rather than manipulate. He considered returning to the loyal hosts, but his pride held him.

Evening Stars and Stories

As the sun lowered again, Luniel rose from behind the hills, her form gentle and luminous. She reflected light from Heliel, bathing the valley in soft silver. Asteriel and the Asterim took their places in the sky, weaving constellations that would serve as stories and guides. Adam lay on his back in the grass, God beside him, and stared upward.

“What are those?” Adam asked, pointing at points of light.

“Stars,” Asteriel said, her voice like a thousand tiny bells. “Each is carried by one of the Asterim. They teach you about orientation and season. They tell stories. They are not to be worshipped or used to predict. They are signs and servants. Tonight, they tell you the story of trust.”

“Tell me,” Adam whispered, eyes fixed on the sky.

Asteriel pointed at a grouping of stars forming a pattern like an arch. “This is The Gate,” she said. “It reminds you of the boundary you crossed when you received breath. It reminds you that boundaries are invitations. Outside the gate is the unknown; inside is provision. There will be gates in your life—choices. Trust leads you through the right ones.” She traced another set of stars. “This is The Ladder. It speaks of communication between heaven and earth. Messages travel. You will not be alone. Even when you cannot see, messages ascend and descend.”

Adam listened, each story sinking into his heart. “They are beautiful,” he said.

“Beauty can anchor truth,” Uriel said. “When you forget words, you will remember patterns. Patterns will guide you.”

The First Lament

As night deepened, Adam felt another emotion, a heaviness not connected to injury or hunger. “I feel … sadness,” he whispered. “But nothing bad happened today. Why do I feel this?”

“This is lament,” Haniel said quietly. “You long for what you have not yet known. Part of you sensed in your dream that another like you will join you. You feel her absence now.”

God placed a hand on Adam’s shoulder. “It is not good for man to be alone,” He said softly. “Your sadness is not a flaw. It is a sign. I did not plant it to wound but to prepare. We are together now. We will bring forth another at the right time. Until then, let lament invite prayer, not despair.”

Adam turned toward God and rested his head against His arm. Tears slipped down his cheeks. “I trust you,” he said between sobs. “I do not understand everything, but I trust.”

God held him. “Trust grows,” He whispered. “It is watered by tears as well as laughter. Let the sadness be part of your worship. Do not hide it.”

Watchers recorded this first lament by marking open circles on their tablets and adding tear drops along the lines of text. They infused the pages with the scent of jasmine, signifying comfort. They noted that lament does not emerge from wrongdoing but from longing.

Midday Rest and Questions

When the sun stood high and shadows fell directly below trees, Adam felt a different kind of heaviness: a dull ache that began in his belly and spread to his limbs. He furrowed his brow and placed a hand against his stomach. “I feel empty here,” he said to God, rubbing the place beneath his ribs. “Is something wrong?”

God smiled and led him to a broad fig tree whose leaves offered shade. “You are hungry,” He explained. “Your body needs fuel. Eating replenishes your strength. It is part of being embodied.” He plucked a ripe fig and handed it to Adam. Its skin was soft and slightly taut; tiny drops of sap beaded where the stem had snapped.

Adam turned the fig over in his hand, feeling its gentle fuzz. “It smells sweet,” he observed, inhaling the fragrance. Naschiel stood nearby, nodding with approval. “May I?” Adam asked. At God’s nod, he bit into the fruit. Warm juice flooded his mouth, and seeds crunched between his teeth. He laughed at the sensation and swallowed. Immediately the ache in his belly dulled.

“Eating is joyful,” he said between bites, juice dripping down his chin. “It is like tasting the sun and soil together.”

“You will need to eat regularly,” Raphael explained, sitting beside him under the tree. “Your body consumes energy as you move and think. Food replenishes what is used. You will learn which fruits and plants sustain you, which herbs heal you, which foods you must not eat without guidance.”

Adam wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then glanced at the fig’s remains. “There are many seeds,” he said, poking at them with his finger. “What happens to them?”

“Seeds contain the pattern of new life,” Choriel, guardian of soil, answered from where he leaned against the trunk. “If you plant them and care for them, they will grow into trees like this one. Each tree produces after its kind.”

Adam imagined a grove of fig trees. “It feels like a gift that multiplies,” he said softly.

After eating, sleepiness crept over him. His eyelids grew heavy, and he yawned. “I feel like when night was coming last time, but it is still light,” he noted, confused.

“Rest comes in cycles,” God explained. “There is sleep at night and rest during the day. Working without rest turns joy into toil. Hunger tells you to eat; weariness tells you to rest. Listen to your body.”

Adam lay down in the shade, curling his arm under his head. “Will you stay?” he asked God.

“Always,” God replied. He sat close as Adam’s breathing slowed. Eariel hushed the surrounding sounds; the stream’s babble softened, bird calls quieted, leaving only the rustle of leaves and the steady rhythm of Adam’s breath. Watchers recorded the cadence, drawing a series of long, looping spirals to signify rest in the midst of daylight.

Council of Senses

While Adam slept, Eariel and Naschiel gathered messengers, healers, and watchers under another tree for a brief council on teaching senses. “Our friend has tasted and touched, seen and heard,” Eariel began, his voice carrying like a clear tone. “He has smelled mint and jasmine. How shall we teach him to interpret what he receives so that he is not overwhelmed?”

Naschiel set a basket of herbs in the center: basil, cedar, sage, thyme, and lemongrass. “We will teach by experience,” she said. “We will not lecture as we did when there were only angels. Humanity learns through embodiment. We will invite him to smell sage when he feels confused, cedar when he needs courage, lemongrass when he needs to awaken. But we must also teach caution. Not all scents bring life. Some plants smell sweet but cause sickness. He must ask before tasting unknown plants. Fragrance and flavour are invitations, not commands.”

Safriel dipped his quill into oil and drew a small symbol of a nose with concentric circles around it. “In the Library of Sequence,” he said, “we will devise a way to record fragrances. Perhaps a strip of cloth infused with oil bound to the page, or a pressed herb. We will note his reactions but not interpret them as law.”

“Sound, too,” Yomiel added. “We should teach him to differentiate between calls of comfort and calls of warning. When the dove coos, he can relax. When the raven caws, he should look around. When water roars louder than normal, perhaps flood is coming. We must embed listening into his daily rhythms so he does not become numb.”

Eariel turned to the messengers. “When we speak to him, we must be mindful of our tone. Volume matters. Whisper when you mean to reassure. Speak clearly when giving instruction. Do not shout unless danger requires it. Words carry weight, but so does tone. Our record should note not only words but how they are spoken.”

Gabriel nodded. “We will practise. We can role-play questions and responses. We will stand at different distances so he learns that voices farther away require greater attention.”

The council continued for some time, each order sharing their perspective. Guardians spoke of using sound to signal when they must intervene. Healers described listening to breath and heartbeat as diagnostic tools. Watchers promised to create margin symbols for different volumes and inflections. When Adam awoke, the council dispersed quietly, leaving behind the faintest aroma of sage on the breeze.

Body and Breath

Later, after his nap, Adam and God walked along the stream. Adam placed a hand over his chest and frowned. “There is a thumping,” he said. “It goes faster when I climb and slower when I rest. Is there someone inside me?”

God chuckled softly. “That is your heart,” He said. “It is a muscle that pumps blood through your body. It beats from the moment I gave you breath until the day your journey here ends. Its rhythm responds to your activity, your emotions, your health. It is hidden but vital.”

Haemiel, still nearby, invited Adam to sit. “May I show you?” he asked. At Adam’s consent, Haemiel placed his hand gently over Adam’s chest and then on his own. “Feel,” he said. Adam felt Haemiel’s strong, steady heartbeat against his palm and then compared it to his own. They beat at different tempos but in the same pattern.

“Why does it speed up?” Adam asked, curious.

“When you exert yourself, your muscles need more blood,” Haemiel explained. “Your heart pumps faster to deliver it. When you are afraid, your body prepares to act. When you rest, it slows.”

“It’s like a drum inside me,” Adam murmured. “Is it always there? Even when I am not thinking of it?”

“Always,” God affirmed. “Some things are constant whether you attend to them or not. My love is like that. It does not depend on your awareness.”

Adam placed both hands on his ribs and inhaled deeply. He felt his lungs expand, his chest lift. Nefeshiel stepped forward, humming the same low tone he had held when breath was gathered. Adam’s breath resonated with the hum, creating a vibration he could feel in his bones. “Breathing is like singing with creation,” Adam said wonderingly. “It moves without me thinking. I can choose to breathe deep or shallow, but it also just … happens.”

“Breath will teach you patience,” Nefeshiel replied. “When emotions rise, slow your breathing. It will steady your heart. When you run, breathe rhythmically. When you are afraid, remember to breathe, for fear tries to make you hold your breath. Breath is invitation and gift.”

Watchers recorded this exchange by drawing waves across the page to represent breath and small dots for heartbeats. They pressed their fingers into the wax to make indentations corresponding to each of Adam’s breaths, creating a tactile record. Later, healers would use these markers to instruct on breathwork.

Conversation with Birds

In the afternoon, a flock of finches landed in a nearby bush, chirping in bright bursts. Adam approached slowly, fascinated by their tiny size and quick movements. “Hello,” he whispered. “Can you understand me?”

The finches tilted their heads, then resumed their chirping. Eariel stepped closer. “Try to imitate,” he suggested gently. Adam pursed his lips and attempted to whistle. His first attempt was a hissing wheeze. He laughed and tried again, shaping his lips and expelling air. A weak whistle emerged. The finches chirped louder, some hopping closer as if in encouragement.

“You see?” Eariel smiled. “Communication is not only language. It is also tone and rhythm. You will never speak finch fluently, but you can share presence. When you speak kindly, creatures sense your heart.”

Adam spent a while listening and attempting to whistle. Each time he produced a sound that approached the birds’ call, his eyes brightened. “It is like singing with them,” he said. “Though I do not know the words.”

“You will learn to name them by observing their behaviour,” God said. “You will call them according to their essence. Their songs will help you know them. And when you speak to them in your language, they will not understand your words, but they will understand your posture and tone. Remember that language is more than sounds. It is heart.”

Watchers recorded Adam’s first whistle by drawing a small spiral within a spiral, indicating an attempt that returns to the source imperfectly. They wrote a note in the margin: “First attempt to speak another tongue. Joyful failure.”

Evening Dance

As evening approached but before darkness fell, Haniel gathered messengers, healers, and a few guardians in a clearing. “Joy is not only a response,” she said, her eyes gleaming. “Joy is preparation. It is prophecy. Let us dance while we wait for night.” She signalled musicians among the angels who began to play. Seraphina plucked a lyre, producing notes that twinkled like early stars. Tamiel beat a small drum, establishing a heartbeat rhythm. Chroniel’s threads hummed, weaving a tempo that corresponded with the pulses of time.

Haniel lifted her arms and began to move with slow, graceful steps. Her movements flowed like water, then like wind, then like the gentle opening of a flower. Adam watched, mesmerised. “May I dance?” he asked.

“Of course,” Haniel said, offering him her hand. Adam took it and stepped into the clearing. He mimicked her steps awkwardly at first, stumbling when his feet did not land where he intended. He laughed at himself, and Haniel laughed with him. “Joy is not about perfection,” she reminded him. “It is about presence.”

He relaxed, letting the rhythm guide him. He swung his arms, lifted his feet, twirled slowly. Soon he was laughing and sweating, the afternoon’s heaviness transformed into exuberance. Other angels joined, their garments flowing, their wings fanning gentle breezes. Even Raphael danced, his movements slower but infused with delight.

As they danced, God watched, His eyes shining. “This is good,” He declared. “Dance teaches coordination and vulnerability. It invites you to inhabit your body with gratitude. It will be a gift you give to future generations.”

Watchers stood at a respectful distance, swaying to the music as they recorded. Safriel tied ribbons into his parchment to mimic movement. Yomiel drew lines that curved and crossed, representing footpaths through the clearing. Seraphina sang a melody that would later remind them of this evening, weaving the notes into a lullaby. When the dance concluded and the sun kissed the horizon, Adam’s heart beat fast but steady. He breathed deeply, cheeks flushed.

“I feel alive,” he whispered.

“You are,” God replied, smiling. “And you will continue to feel more alive as you learn. Joy strengthens you for sorrow. Movement prepares you for stillness. Every rhythm has its time.”

Haniel wiped sweat from her brow and bowed to God. “Thank you for the gift of movement,” she said.

“Thank you for receiving it,” God responded.

As twilight settled, they moved toward the field where Asteriel and the Asterim prepared to tell their stories. The dance’s warmth lingered in their bodies, and the first stars flickered above like promises.

Scene Break
