Chapter 3 — Naming the World
The Summoning to Name

The dawn of Adam’s second day bled into gold. Dew clung to blades of grass, reflecting tiny suns. Birds sang in layers, their songs weaving together like threads in a tapestry. The scent of wet earth and blossoms hung in the air. Adam awoke slowly, stretching his limbs and feeling the soreness from the previous day’s dance. The ache was not unpleasant; it was like the memory of laughter lodged in his muscles.

God knelt beside him and brushed a piece of grass from his curls. “Good morning, Adam,” He said. “Today you will discover the power of naming.”

“Naming?” Adam repeated, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“Yes,” God replied. “You will give names to the creatures I bring to you. Naming is not about ownership or control. It is about recognising essence. It is an act of relationship and stewardship. You will call each creature according to what you observe and feel. The names you give will carry weight. They will teach others how to see.”

Adam’s heart thumped a little faster. He sat up fully. “Will the creatures come one by one?” he asked. He had seen many animals from a distance the day before. He remembered the deer’s soft fur and the finches’ song. The thought of meeting more stirred a mixture of excitement and apprehension.

“They will come in groups,” God said. “You will not name them all today, nor must you rush. We will go slowly. Listen as much as you speak. Names will rise like bubbles from your heart when you are ready.”

Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel approached, along with Haniel, Saraqael, and a host of watchers. Safriel carried a large scroll bound with a leather strap. He unrolled it and spread it on a flat rock. The parchment was blank but for faint margin lines and small symbols to mark time pulses. “This will be the record of names,” he said. “We will write them in the order you speak them. We will leave space beside each name for notes, colours, fragrances, and drawings.”

Ophiel, the angel of sight, arrived with shimmering eyes that reflected the colours of dawn. Haptiel, angel of touch, stood ready to help Adam feel textures of fur and feather. Eariel and Naschiel looked on to note any sounds and scents associated with names. The library of names would not only hold syllables but senses.

“Are you ready?” God asked.

Adam nodded, though his stomach fluttered. “I am nervous,” he admitted. “What if I choose wrong?”

“Do not fear,” God said gently. “There is grace in learning. You cannot name wrongly when you name with love. If you find later that a name does not fit, we will revisit it together. But remember: names shape relationship. Be careful not to name out of haste or frustration. Your first impulse may be joy or humour; follow it, but test it in time. A name born of jest can become a wound if it belittles.”

Saraqael, his scroll at the ready, added this counsel to the canon on the margin: “Names are invitations, not labels. They point to essence, they do not confine.” He drew a small open circle next to the sentence, indicating that the statement would need further reflection.

First Encounters

They walked to a wide meadow near a grove of trees. The grass waved like a sea. In the distance, a herd of large creatures grazed. Their bodies were broad and muscular, covered in short, coarse hair that glistened like gold. Two of them raised their heads, revealing long, curved horns that spiraled from their skulls like branches of polished wood. Their eyes were gentle and dark.

Adam gasped. “They are strong,” he said, awed by their size. He stepped forward slowly so as not to startle them. “May I?” he asked, looking at God.

“Yes,” God said. “Approach them with respect. Let them smell you.”

Adam extended his hand. One of the horned creatures lowered its head and sniffed his palm. Its breath was warm and moist. Its nostrils flared, drawing in his scent. It nudged his hand gently, and Adam laughed. “Hello,” he whispered. He walked around the creature, admiring the way its muscles rippled beneath its hide. It had a tail that swished lazily to flick away insects. He placed his hand on its flank. It was hard beneath a layer of fur, like a tree trunk covered with moss.

“What will you call me?” the creature’s eyes seemed to ask, though it did not speak.

Adam thought of the horns that grew from its head like crowns. He thought of the way it breathed and chewed methodically. A word formed on his tongue. “Ox,” he said. The creature raised its head, as if acknowledging. Adam smiled. “You are Ox,” he repeated. “Strong and steady.”

Safriel wrote “Ox” on the scroll. He then dipped his quill in a pot of brown pigment and drew a simple outline of the animal, adding a curl to indicate the horns. He wrote a small note: “Named for strength and horns.” Naschiel pressed a piece of the creature’s coarse hair onto the page with a bit of tree resin. The page smelled faintly of hay and sweat.

Next came a pair of creatures with long legs and slender necks. Their coats were spotted with irregular patches of tan and brown. They looked down at Adam from a great height, blinking slowly. Their eyelashes were long and thick, giving them a gentle appearance despite their towering stature. Adam craned his neck to meet their gaze.

“You are very tall,” he said with a laugh. He stretched his arms upward, but they barely reached halfway up their legs. He walked in circles around them. Their spots reminded him of dappled sunlight on the forest floor. He placed his palm against one of their legs. It was smooth and firm. He could feel tendons flex beneath skin. He touched his own neck, then their necks, noting the difference.

“Their necks stretch like trunks of young trees,” Ophiel observed quietly. “They can reach leaves no other creature can. They teach humility to the short and caution to themselves.”

Adam considered this. “Their necks make me think of reaching beyond,” he said. “I will call you ‘Zamar,’ because your necks rise like the strings of an instrument.” He thought of the word spontaneously; later, watchers would transliterate it into many languages. The creatures blinked again, as if pleased.

“Zamar,” Safriel wrote, careful to capture the unusual syllables. He attached a thin strip of bark from the tree the creatures liked to nibble, pressing it into the margin. He wrote: “Tall, patterned, with long necks—names evoke music and reach.”

The next group approached on hoofed feet smaller than the ox’s but quick and sure. Their bodies were sleek and tan, with white underbellies and small horns. They moved in a cluster, pausing and then darting away, only to circle back. Their eyes were wide and alert, ears flicking in every direction. Their movements reminded Adam of the skipping motion he had made in his dance.

“They bounce,” Adam remarked. “They are playful and swift. They make me laugh.” He watched as one of them leaped over a small bush. “I will call you ‘Deer,’ because you are dear to watch.” He repeated the word, savouring the way it rolled from his tongue. “Deer.” The creatures flicked their tails and bounded away, only to return and nuzzle his hand.

“Deer,” Safriel recorded. He drew an outline of their slender bodies in one fluid line. Haniel hummed a melody with a light, skipping rhythm and said, “I will weave this into a dance for children to imitate them.”

A low rumble reverberated through the ground. Adam turned to see a massive shape emerging from the trees. Its head rose above the canopy. It had a large, elongated trunk that hung like an arm from its face and two huge ivory tusks curved forward. Its ears were wide, like curtains that fanned back and forth. Its skin was thick, wrinkled, and grey, like stone shaped by water.

Adam’s breath caught. “You are … enormous,” he whispered. He walked toward the creature, feeling tiny in its shadow. “May I?” he asked God again.

“Yes,” God said. “Touch gently.”

Adam placed his hand on the creature’s leg. It felt like tree bark, rough and warm. The creature lowered its trunk and sniffed him. Its trunk was flexible and strong. It wrapped gently around his waist, lifting him slightly off the ground. Adam gasped and then laughed as it set him back down. “You are strong, but you are also gentle,” he said, staring into its deep, knowing eyes. “Your nose is like a hand, and your voice shakes the earth.” He closed his eyes, listening to the rumbling. He thought of the weight and the wisdom he felt emanating from the creature.

“Elephant,” he said softly. “Because you elevate me and you are bent like a river that remembers where it has been.”

The animal flapped its ears, spraying warm air. Safriel wrote “Elephant” and drew a long curving line to represent the trunk. Haptiel pressed the page into the animal’s skin to capture the wrinkles. Eariel leaned close and captured the low frequencies of its rumble in his memory, intending to replicate them later.

Animals of all kinds appeared: a furry creature that hopped using powerful hind legs and had a pouch on its belly; Adam named it “Kangar,” because its movements made him think of a playful bound. A creature with a shell on its back that withdrew into its shell when he touched it; he called it “Shelter.” A colorful bird with a beak that curved like a sickle and feathers that shimmered; he called it “Sunbow.” A small creature that curled into a ball when startled; he named it “Curl.” A slithering being with scales that reflected sunlight; he named it “Slyth,” aware of the serpent in his dream but not yet connecting this creature to danger.

With each animal, Adam took time. He observed, touched, listened. He noted the texture of fur, the pattern of scales, the sound of hooves, the scent of feathers. He named based on essence and relationship. Some names were descriptive, like “Longtail” for a monkey that swung by its tail. Some were onomatopoetic, like “Hiss” for a snake that made a soft hissing noise. Some were imaginative, like “Windrunner” for a swift horse whose mane streamed like cloud wisps.

At one point, a tiny insect landed on Adam’s arm. It had delicate wings and a slender body. Its colour was metallic green, and it hovered in place with a soft hum. “Beautiful,” Adam whispered. “You look like a bit of leaf that chose to fly.” It dipped its body into a nearby flower, drawing out nectar. “I will call you ‘Bea,’ because you drink beauty and make honey,” he said. The insect hummed and flew to another blossom.

“Bea,” Safriel wrote, adding a small note: “Honey maker; name arises from beauty and work.” Later, Naschiel would attach a drop of honey to the page.

Ophiel leaned toward Adam as he watched the animals. “Notice how the creatures move,” he instructed. “Movement often reveals character. The way a lion carries his weight; the way a rabbit freezes when he senses danger; the way an eagle rides thermals. All speak of their essence. Names can capture movement too.”

Adam nodded, storing the advice. A creature approached with flowing mane and a gentle eye. It whickered softly, blowing out warm air through wide nostrils. Adam ran his hand along its flank. Its muscles quivered under his touch. He felt power coiled like a spring. He took note of its hooves, the way it pawed the ground. “You are strong and fast and carry yourself with grace,” he said. “Your steps sound like thunder but your breath is soft. I will call you ‘Horse,’ because you are a harmony of hooves and serenity.”

Council on Naming

By midday, Adam had named many creatures. He sat beneath a tree to rest his voice and mind. God ordered food and water to be brought. Angels gathered around to reflect on the morning.

Gabriel spoke first. “You have named with care,” he said to Adam. “Your names reveal what you see, hear, feel. But remember: names will become common. Others will use them. They may forget why you chose them. The meaning may be lost if not recorded.” He looked at the watchers.

Saraqael nodded. “We will write not only the names, but the reasoning behind them. We will include context: the way the sun warmed the elephant’s back when you touched it, the scent of the fig tree when you named the deer, the laughter in your voice when you named the kangaroo. Names without story become brittle. Story preserves warmth.”

“Names also shape your heart,” Haniel added gently. “If you name with contempt, your heart will lean toward contempt. If you name with love, your heart will grow in love. Be aware of the posture from which you name.”

Raphael spoke about healing. “When you name a wound, you acknowledge its existence. When you name an illness, you can begin to treat it. But if you misname a wound, you may misdiagnose and harm. There is power in accurate naming. You will learn to name herbs and parts of your body too.”

Ophiel raised another point. “There will come a day when you meet another like you. She will have her own essence. You will not name her as you have named the animals. You will recognise her as equal. Names used for humans are not like names for creatures. They are invitations into covenant. Choose with reverence.”

Adam’s pulse quickened at the reminder. His heart yearned again. He nodded. “I will wait,” he whispered.

God turned to the adversary’s camp across the veil. Though fallen watchers could not intervene, they listened. God spoke to Adam. “There will come those who twist names. They will call what is bitter sweet and what is sweet bitter. They will rename boundaries as prisons and freedom as bondage. You must cling to truth. When in doubt, ask Me. Do not simply accept others’ names without discernment.”

Gadreel, hearing this from afar, smirked. “We will use names to confuse,” he whispered to Penemue. “We will present alternative names for the same thing until he questions his own. We will sow doubt by renaming.” Penemue scribbled mental notes.

Samyaza, listening with a conflicted heart, felt discomfort. He remembered the council of voices from earlier. He decided to talk to Saraqael later. The weight of naming pressed even on those who planned to twist it.

Glossiel’s Lesson on Words

After the council dispersed, a new figure stepped from behind a stand of reeds. His form shimmered like sunlight seen through clear water, and his voice resonated with a musical cadence even when he was silent. “I am Glossiel,” he said, bowing slightly to Adam. “I am an angel of language. I tend the bridges between thought and speech. I help creation articulate without violence.”

Adam regarded him with curiosity. “Language feels like breath turned into shape,” he said, thinking of the syllables he had spoken that morning. “My mouth and tongue move and something comes out. Sometimes I know what I will say, and sometimes words surprise me.”

“Exactly,” Glossiel replied. “Words are births. They begin inside and emerge. They have weight and direction. They can build and they can break. I am here to teach you how to steward them. Pronunciation matters. The way you shape your mouth when you speak a name can add honour or contempt. Listen to how a word feels against your teeth and lips. Speak slowly at first. Do not rush through sounds as if they are obstacles.”

He held out a small branch and asked Adam to repeat the names he had given earlier. “Ox,” he said, enunciating the guttural consonant. Adam repeated, feeling the vibration in his throat. Glossiel nodded. “The firmness of your voice matches the creature’s strength. Now say ‘Zamar,’” he instructed. Adam rolled the ‘r’ at the end without realising. “Feel how the word stretches like their neck?” Glossiel said. “Your tongue must climb and descend. Words mirror what they describe.”

Glossiel picked up a pebble and tossed it lightly. “When you named the tiny creature ‘Curl,’ your lips curled inward. That was fitting. Your body knows how to name before your mind does.” He smiled, the sound of his smile like water tinkling over stone. “But be careful. Words can be twisted. A mispronounced blessing can sound like a curse. A hastily spoken name can sound mocking. Intention travels on tone.”

He turned his attention to the watchers. “When you write a name, leave space for notes on pronunciation,” he advised. Safriel nodded and drew a new symbol—a series of short lines above a word to indicate emphasis and a wavy line beneath to signal lengthening. “We will create a companion key,” Safriel said, excited by the challenge.

Glossiel then asked Adam to place his hand over his throat as he spoke. “Say your own name,” he urged. Adam pressed his hand against his throat and said slowly, “A … dam.” He felt his vocal cords vibrate and his tongue press against his teeth. “Your name has two syllables,” Glossiel said. “The first is open and vowel‑rich, like a sigh; the second closes against your lip. You begin with openness and you end with finality. This teaches you that your life is a journey from gift to gift. Every time you speak your name, remember its rhythm.”

Haniel stepped forward and echoed the syllables of Adam’s name in a song, stretching the vowel and then resting on the consonant. “We will teach your children to sing their names with reverence,” she promised. Glossiel smiled approvingly.

“Will there be other languages?” Adam asked, remembering the complexity he sensed in sound. “Will others speak differently?”

“Yes,” Glossiel replied. “In time, languages will multiply. Words will sound different across lands and tribes. The essence of names may remain, but their forms will vary. In one tongue a river may be called ‘Pishon,’ in another ‘Pisanu,’ but the character of abundance will remain. My work will be to tend translation so essence is not lost. Humanity will need humility to listen across differences.”

God interjected gently. “Language will one day be used to unite in pride. I will confuse tongues to slow harm. When that happens, Glossiel will be there to weave understanding when humility returns.” Glossiel bowed his head.

Glossiel then spoke of blessings. “Words can bless,” he said, turning back to Adam. “A blessing names what is good and speaks it forth. Try now. Choose one creature you named and speak a blessing.”

Adam thought of the bees. He smiled and spoke aloud, “Bea, may your hives always be full, and may your honey always be sweet. May your dance teach us where flowers are, and may we never steal without giving thanks.”

The hum of nearby bees rose for a moment as if in response. Glossiel closed his eyes. “Well done,” he said. “Blessings flow like rivers. Curses also flow. Never curse. Cursing names what is evil and binds you to it. If harm must be addressed, describe it truthfully and invite healing rather than call it identity.”

Glossiel placed his hand over Adam’s heart. “Your mouth will be your most dangerous tool,” he said softly. “You will carve reality with it. You will build worlds with words. Practise speaking intentionally now, while your vocabulary is small, so that when it grows you do not lose humility.”

Adam felt a weight settle on him—not heavy like shame, but solemn like the sensation of holding a newborn animal. He nodded. “I will practise,” he promised. “I will ask before I speak hard things.”

Watchers recorded Glossiel’s lesson in meticulous detail. Safriel drew a small emblem to represent Glossiel—an ear, a mouth, and a hand joined by a line. He wrote about pronunciation, blessings, and the coming multiplicity of languages. Yomiel suggested that future scrolls include musical notation beside key names so that readers could sing them. Saraqael wondered whether they would need to create entire dictionaries in the Library of Sequence. The library’s potential expanded again.

Glossiel bowed and stepped back into the company of angels. “I will be near,” he promised. “Every word spoken ripples through me. Speak well.”

Naming Rivers and Stones

After the council, God led Adam down to the edge of the garden where rivers flowed. Four great rivers issued forth from a single source, splitting and travelling in different directions. The water ran clear and cold, tumbling over stones, pooling in gentle eddies, then plunging down falls.

“You will name these rivers,” God said. “They will water the garden and beyond. Their names will carry meaning for those who dwell near them. Listen to their voice.”

Adam knelt and placed his ear near the water. He heard a constant whisper, but each river had a different tone. The first river flowed through a land rich with glittering stones and golden sand. Its sound was like laughter over pebbles, high and bright. The sun reflected off its surface, scattering light like diamonds.

“This river sings of abundance,” Adam said. “Its sound is like a joyful dance. I will call you ‘Pishon,’ because you spread and overflow like a mouth filled with blessing.”

Safriel wrote “Pishon,” adding a smear of gold dust between the letters. He wrote in the margin: “Abundant flow; land with bdellium and onyx.” Choriel pressed a small pebble of quartz into the page.

The second river flowed through a land lush with trees that bore resin and fragrant spices. Its sound was deeper, like a steady pulse. It smelled of sap and bark and spice.

“This one feels like a heartbeat,” Adam murmured. He touched the water; it was slightly warmer. He felt the current pull his hand gently but firmly. “I will call you ‘Gihon,’ because you burst forth from within and you circle like a sentinel.”

Safriel recorded the name and attached a piece of cinnamon bark. Naschiel infused the page with a drop of resin. A small sketch of swirling currents accompanied the word.

The third river passed through a rocky land. Its course was straight, cutting through ravines with power. Its sound was like a roar. It carved deep grooves as it travelled.

“You cut through stone,” Adam said. “You do not meander. You are direct and persistent. I will call you ‘Tigris,’ because you are swift like an arrow.”

The final river was broad and winding. It moved at a slower pace, carrying rich silt. Its waters were deep and calm on the surface, but powerful underneath. The animals drank from it. Trees with great roots grew along its banks.

“You nourish quietly,” Adam observed. “You are wide and you bring life everywhere you go. I will call you ‘Euphrates,’ because you are fruitful and you bear fruit generously.”

Safriel recorded both names, drawing long undulating lines for the Tigris and wide sweeping curves for the Euphrates. He left blank space along the margin to attach pressed leaves later.

Nearby, stones of various kinds littered the riverbank. Adam knelt and picked up a smooth, flat stone. Its surface was cold and wet. He threw it into the water and watched it skip once, twice, three times before sinking. “You dance,” he whispered. He picked up a heavier stone; it plunked into the water and sank with a satisfying splash. “You sink.” He laughed.

God smiled. “You may name stones too if you wish,” He said. “But remember, names can be personal. Stones may not need a universal name; perhaps they only need names when you build or when you remember.”

Adam nodded. He placed a stone in his pocket. “I will call you ‘Memory,’” he said. “Because when I hold you later, I will remember this moment.”

Watchers recorded the concept of naming objects temporarily for personal remembrance. Safriel noted to include a small pouch in the library where memory stones could be stored. He scribbled: “Names can be intimate and not recorded if they serve personal remembrance.”

Conversation About Names

As the sun dipped toward the horizon again, turning the rivers into ribbons of fire, Adam and God sat on a large boulder. The day’s work of naming had been both exhilarating and exhausting. Adam’s mind buzzed with the sound of his own voice uttering new words.

“Why am I called Adam?” he asked quietly, turning the word over in his mouth as if tasting it anew. “You named me. What does my name mean?”

God looked at him with tenderness. “You are called Adam because you came from the adamah—the ground. Your body is earth and water shaped by my hands. You are also more than earth. I breathed into you. Your name reminds you of your humility and your dignity. You are dust and breath together. You are meant to cultivate the ground, to steward it, and to remember your dependence on it. The sound of your name echoes the sound of the ground being tilled. ‘Adam’ and ‘adamah’ are related so you will never forget where you came from.”

Adam traced his fingers along the stone they sat on. He thought of the soil he had felt when God formed him. “When I say my own name, I will remember the ground,” he said. “Thank you for naming me.”

“You do not need to name yourself again,” God said with a smile. “Nor will you name another person without my guidance. Names for humans come from Me because they carry destiny. When you one day call your partner by the name I give her, it will be your agreement with my choice, not your own invention.”

Adam nodded, a mixture of relief and anticipation washing over him.

“I noticed some animals came in pairs,” he said after a while. “Two deer. Two oxen. Two horses. But I am one. You said it is not good for me to be alone.”

“That is true,” God affirmed. “Today was about learning your voice. It was about discovering that words have power. Tomorrow we will walk together and talk about work and rest. In time, we will address your loneliness.”

Adam accepted this, though his heart ached. “Naming felt good,” he said, shifting the conversation. “It felt like revealing secrets. Like listening and then speaking truth.”

“That is what naming should feel like,” God said. “It is a gift. It invites intimacy. It reveals. Never use names to mock or diminish. When others misname, do not follow. Ask Me for clarity. Names can heal or wound.”

Nearby, Saraqael scribbled: “Names reveal secrets when given in relationship. Naming is listening and then speaking truth. Names can heal or wound.” He added a tear drop symbol to indicate the weight of the last sentence.

Evening Reflection

When the stars emerged and constellations took their places, Adam lay on his back again, fatigue and satisfaction mingling in his bones. He looked at the patterns Asteriel wove and whispered each river’s name under his breath, delighting in the way the words felt. He remembered the muscles of the elephant under his hand, the softness of the deer’s nose, the roughness of the ox’s tongue. He remembered the birds singing and the hum of bees. He remembered the laughter when the kangaroo had surprised him by bounding sideways. He remembered the solemn weight of the Tigris and the gentle curve of the Euphrates.

“Today was full,” he said to God, who lay beside him. “My mouth is tired from speaking.”

“Then rest,” God replied. He placed His hand over Adam’s chest. “Feel your heartbeat. Let it slow. Tonight your dreams may replay some of what you named. Do not hold tightly to them. Tomorrow will have its own lessons.”

Adam sighed. His heartbeat echoed like a drum in the night. He closed his eyes, but his mind kept circling back to the animals he had met. “Will the names I gave be their names forever?” he asked sleepily.

“As long as they fit and you speak them with respect,” God answered. “Names can deepen. You may call a horse ‘Windrunner’ when you see it galloping and ‘Friend’ when it stays with you. Both can be true. Names can multiply to reflect relationship.”

Adam smiled. “I like that,” he murmured. His breathing slowed. His fingers loosened around the memory stone he still held. He drifted into sleep under the gaze of the stars.

Watchers lingered by the firelight, comparing notes. Safriel rolled the naming scroll carefully and placed it in a leather tube. “We will need many scrolls,” he said. “There is no end to names.” Yomiel nodded and suggested new symbols for names given with laughter versus names spoken in sobriety. Saraqael planned a council for the next day to decide how to store scent and sound with each name. The library expanded in imagination as the garden expanded in life.

Across the way, the adversary’s camp gathered around a dim flame. Gadreel scowled. “We must act soon,” he muttered. “He is forming language. Once words have roots, they are harder to uproot.” Penemue looked thoughtful. “Perhaps we can influence how he defines words rather than the words themselves,” he mused. Thaliel remained silent, feeling the weight of his own name heavy on his tongue.

The night deepened, and silence settled over the valley. Nefeshiel hummed his low tone, and Adam’s breath responded. Lament and anticipation coexisted. The world waited.

Scene Break
