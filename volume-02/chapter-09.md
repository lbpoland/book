Chapter 9 — The First Question

The day after the shimmering serpent had been seen, the garden woke slowly. Dawn crept across the horizon, painting pink onto clouds and dew. Auriel’s blush whispered promise. The hum of Chroniel’s threads vibrated through the soil, marking the pulse of morning. In the fig grove, watchers stirred, sleep clinging to their eyes. Safriel sat with his back against a fig trunk, his journal open on his lap, the smell of neroli oil still present from the previous night’s prayer. His stylus hovered above the page, suspended between the weight of what he felt and the urge to document.

Yomiel emerged from behind a bush, his hair damp from the stream, carrying two smooth stones. “I could not sleep,” he admitted, sitting beside Safriel. “Every time I closed my eyes I saw scales shimmering. I heard whispers: ‘Why wait?’ ‘What is death?’ Words we have spoken twisted by a tongue I cannot see.”

Safriel nodded. “I dreamed of the star ‘Watch’ falling out of the pattern,” he said quietly. “It fell and the constellation broke. I reached to catch it, but my hand passed through light. The threads hummed faster and my heart raced. I woke with my hand in the air.”

“We cannot catch stars,” Yomiel said. “We can only watch them fall.” He picked up his stylus and, on his stone, scratched a tiny star falling from the “Protect” pattern. “I will keep this as a reminder to pray.”

Saraqael walked over, carrying a small bowl of water and herbs. “Wash your faces,” he said. “Sleep clings like dew. Remove it so you may see clearly.” He dipped a comfrey leaf in the water and handed it to each watcher to wipe their eyes. “We cannot record truth if our vision is clouded by fear.”

Safriel wiped his eyes. The cool water refreshed him. He inhaled the herb’s earthy scent and felt his shoulders loosen. “Thank you,” he whispered.

Petahel arrived with a piece of bark in his hand. He had drawn the serpent again during the night, this time focusing on the eyes. “They are like pools,” he said, showing his drawing. “When I looked at them, I saw my own reflection distorted. I saw myself reaching for fruit. I wrote below: ‘Eyes that show the watcher his own question.’”

“Your reflection revealed what?” Armaros asked, joining the group.

“Desire,” Petahel admitted. “Not for the fruit itself, but for understanding. I wanted to understand everything at once. The eyes reflected that longing back at me. It frightened me.”

Saraqael placed a hand on his shoulder. “Desire will always reflect back at you when you look into the eyes of temptation,” he said. “That is why we must look at God more than at the fruit. What we gaze upon shapes our desires.”

Council of Preparation

Later that morning, God summoned the watchers, guardians, messengers, and healers to a clearing shaded by tall poplars. The leaves rustled like whispers, echoing the questions swirling in the watchers’ minds. Adam and Eve sat together on a fallen log, their hands intertwined. The Bright One stood several paces away under a fig tree, his arms crossed. Gadreel and Penemue stood near him, quills tucked behind their ears. Samyaza and Thaliel were present but stood on the opposite side of the clearing, nearer to Saraqael and Remiel.

“You have seen a new creature,” God said, addressing them all. “You have felt its questions. You have felt your own hearts echo those questions. Today, we speak of curiosity and its purpose.”

He looked at Adam and Eve. “You will see many creatures,” He told them. “Some will invite joy. Some will invite caution. Some will invite both. The shimmering creature you saw among the vines is one of My creations. It is called ‘nahash’ in the tongue of the watchers, though you have not yet named it. It moves without legs, listens with its entire body, and tastes the air with its tongue. It hears what is spoken and unspoken. It reflects what is hidden in the heart. It will cross your path. When it speaks, it will ask questions. Questions are not sin. They are invitations. You must consider who asks, and why.”

Eve nodded slowly. “I felt the pull of its beauty,” she said. “I felt the questions swirl in my chest. I wanted to follow it through the vines. But I also felt caution. My feet stayed.”

“The caution was My Spirit,” God said. “I speak through peace as well as words. Listen for the difference between peace and agitation. Curiosity tethered to peace invites wonder. Curiosity tethered to fear invites suspicion. Do not quench curiosity. Bring it to Me. Ask. I will answer.”

Adam looked at God. “Will we meet nahash today?” he asked.

God smiled gently. “Perhaps,” He said. “If you do, remember what I have told you. Ask before you answer. Listen before you act.”

God turned to the watchers. “Record what you see, not what you imagine,” He instructed. “Do not add motives to the serpent’s questions. Do not ascribe to Eve intentions she has not spoken. Do not call the creature a deceiver until deception has occurred. Your records must be precise. They will be used for teaching and healing after you have passed from sight. Accuracy is compassion for those who will read.”

Kokabriel bowed. “We will obey,” he said. “We will record words and tone. We will leave space for unknown motives. We will allow our tremor lines to speak but not speak for us.”

“Guardians,” God continued, turning to Rahab, Peliel, Rivqiel, and Choriel, “you may not intervene until harm threatens life. You may roar when deception slides toward harm. You may speak if you are asked. Otherwise, hold your post.”

Rahab’s jaw tightened. “I will roar when called,” he promised. “My throat burns already.”

Peliel placed his hand on his heart. “My current is ready,” he said. “I will guide if crossing occurs. But I will not push or pull.”

God then looked at the Bright One. “My friend,” He said softly, “your questions are heavy. Bring them to Me. Do not carry them alone. Ask Me before you ask them. Trust that I know the right time to answer.”

The Bright One inclined his head. “I hear You,” he replied. “I am… listening.” But his eyes slid toward Gadreel and Penemue. His fingers flexed at his sides. His wings twitched imperceptibly.

Preparing the Form

After the council dispersed, the Bright One gathered Gadreel and Penemue in a shaded grove near the river, out of view of Adam and Eve but not out of God’s hearing. He rolled his shoulders and closed his eyes. His body shimmered, then began to change. His wings folded inward and seemed to melt into his spine. His legs elongated and fused together, becoming a single, slender trunk. His arms shrank, then folded into his sides. Scales grew where feathers had been. Colours rippled across them, catching and reflecting light like wet stones. His face elongated, his ears sliding to the side of his head, his eyes becoming round and larger, his pupils narrowing into slits. His mouth lengthened into a flexible muzzle. When he opened it, two small fangs glistened, though there was no venom behind them; they were more for grasping than for harm. A tongue forked like branches flickered out, tasting the air. In his new form, he was both beautiful and unsettling.

Gadreel gasped. “You look… magnificent,” he whispered.

Penemue’s pen shook. “You are like the creature we saw,” he said. “No wings. No arms. But your eyes… They are still yours.”

The Bright One lowered his head, the scales along his spine rustling. “This form is efficient,” he said. His voice sounded different, sibilant, like wind through reeds. “I can glide through grass. I can remain unseen among roots. I can approach without alarming them. They will think I am part of creation, which I am. I will not appear as a threat.”

“Are you comfortable?” Penemue asked.

“Comfort is irrelevant,” the Bright One replied. “Purpose matters. This form serves my purpose.” He tasted the air, catching scents: fig, mint, earth, the river, the musky sweetness of animals, and the faint, familiar scent of the woman. He closed his eyes and allowed the scents to separate in his mind. “She is near the tree,” he said. “And she is alone. The man is weaving baskets with Choriel. The time is now.”

Samyaza approached from behind a tree. His eyes widened when he saw the transformed Bright One. He pressed a hand to his heart. “Is this necessary?” he asked, voice trembling. “You change your form. You hide yourself. Are you not still yourself?”

The Bright One turned his head toward Samyaza. His eyes blinked sideways, translucent lids sliding over them. “I am still myself,” he said. “This is a tool. When we spoke to the humans before, they saw our wings and were awed. They might not listen if they recognise me. They might not listen if I come with my voice alone. This form will help them hear without fear.”

Samyaza swallowed. “I will record,” he said. “I will pray.”

“Record carefully,” the Bright One murmured. “Record that I did not lie. Record their questions and mine. Record their freedom.” He slid his body onto the grass, moving more quickly than seemed possible. His scales made only the faintest of sounds—shhhh—as they brushed leaves. He glided toward the grove where the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood.

Approach to the Tree

Eve was in the grove, alone for the first time since she and Adam had touched the tree. She carried a basket of woven reeds on her hip, filled with herbs and small stones. The air was still. The stream around the trees gurgled softly. The leaves rustled with a gentle breeze. The two trees stood as they had before: the tree of life tall and luminous with softly glowing fruit; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil darker, smaller, with fruit that glowed like embers. The scent of the forbidden fruit drifted across the grove—sweet and sharp, deep and complex. It tugged at the back of her throat.

She set her basket down at the base of the life tree and knelt, placing her hands on the moss. She closed her eyes and breathed, letting the fragrance of life fruit fill her nose. She spoke quietly: “Thank You for figs, for grapes, for herbs, for the sound of water. Thank You for the way vines cling to trees. Thank You for the feeling of thread between my fingers. Thank You for the trust You give us. Teach me to listen.”

Nearby, hidden among ferns, Safriel crouched with Kokabriel and Yomiel. They positioned themselves so they could see and hear without being seen. Safriel recorded the woman’s prayer. Kokabriel listened to her tone. Yomiel traced her posture on his wax tablet, the shape of kneeling, hands open.

The serpent approached slowly, unseen by the woman at first. It wove through the tall grass, its scales brushing stems. Each movement was deliberate, graceful, almost like a dancer or a weaver. When it reached the edge of the grove, it paused. Its tongue flickered, tasting the air again. It lifted its head slightly. It looked at Eve. It noted her posture. It listened to her prayer. It waited until she finished speaking.

The watchers held their breath. Their pens hovered above tablets. Rahab, hidden behind a thick trunk, tightened his jaw. Rivqiel gripped a boundary stone. Samyaza’s hands shook. Thaliel prayed silently, tears streaming down her cheeks. Penemue’s eyes were wide, his pen poised.

The serpent slithered closer, closing the distance between itself and the woman. It came to a stop a few paces away, just beyond the stream that encircled the trees. It coiled its body, lifting its head to be level with Eve’s waist. Its scales shimmered. Its eyes reflected the grove, the fruit, the woman’s face.

In a voice smooth and gentle, like oil over water, it spoke. “Did God really say,” the serpent asked, its tongue flickering between words, “you must not eat from any tree in the garden?”

Eve startled slightly, turning toward the voice. Her eyes widened. She saw the serpent, its beauty and strangeness. She did not draw back in fear. She remembered God’s instruction: ask before answering. “May I speak with you?” she asked, her voice clear.

“You may,” the serpent replied. “I have asked you a question. Will you answer?”

She tilted her head. “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,” she said. “We eat figs and grapes and pears and pomegranates. But God said, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not eat it or you will die.’” She glanced at the forbidden tree, then back at the serpent. “We touched it yesterday,” she added, “and we did not die. The boundary is eating.”

Safriel wrote quickly: “Serpent: ‘Did God really say you must not eat from any tree?’ Eve: Clarifies permission and boundary; mentions touching without eating.” He drew two lines: one representing the serpent’s question, another representing Eve’s answer, connected by a small open circle to show the invitation.

Kokabriel noted the serpent’s tone—gentle, almost caring. He recorded the way the question was framed: broad, inviting clarification rather than directly challenging. Yomiel drew the serpent’s head with a small question mark in its eye.

The serpent’s tongue flicked again. It listened to her words. “You will not certainly die,” it said quietly, its voice carrying conviction. “God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” It paused. “He is withholding because He fears your becoming like Him. He says He wants relationship, but He withholds knowledge that could elevate you. Would a good teacher withhold wisdom from His students forever? Is timing a kindness or a control?”

At the edge of the grove, Saraqael’s head snapped up. He felt his heart pound. He looked at Rahab, ready to speak. Rahab shook his head slightly but kept his gaze fixed on the serpent. The guardians remained silent.

Eve frowned slightly. “He did not say forever,” she replied. “He said ‘not yet.’ He said we would surely die if we ate now. He said the knowledge would separate us if our love was not ready. He said to trust His timing. He said desire is good but must be held by trust.” She looked at the tree. The fruit glowed softly, the scent wrapping around her like a shawl. Her mouth watered. Her heart beat faster. A longing stirred within her—desire for the fruit and desire for the knowledge of why not. She tasted the words of the serpent in her mouth. They were sweet and bitter.

The serpent watched her face intently. “Death,” it said, tasting the word. “What is death? You have never seen it. The promise of something you do not understand is used to keep you from something beautiful you can see. How can you trust a consequence you cannot feel? You are intelligent. You name things. You understand patterns. You learn quickly. Why should you wait when knowledge lies within reach?” It lowered its head slightly. “Perhaps He is not ready to share authority. Perhaps He does not trust you as He says. Perhaps you need to trust yourself.”

Penemue’s hand shook. He wrote the serpent’s words, his quill blotting the page when the serpent implied that God did not trust the woman. Gadreel grinned slightly, his eyes bright. Samyaza swallowed hard. Thaliel pressed her forehead to the earth.

Eve’s brow furrowed. She reached out and placed her hand on the trunk of the knowledge tree, feeling the warmth and coolness, the hum. She remembered God’s hand on her shoulder, the way His presence had felt stronger than her desire. She thought of Adam’s thumb scar and the flint. She thought of lambs slipping and learning. She thought of dew waiting on leaves. She thought of the shimmering serpent’s eyes reflecting her own face. She looked back at the serpent. “Why do you ask?” she said quietly. “Why do you care whether we eat?”

The serpent’s head tilted, as if considering. “Because I love knowledge,” it replied. “Because I wish to see creation flourish. Because I see potential in you. Because I believe you should not be limited by fear. Because I desire your elevation.” It slid a little closer, its scales shimmering. “My questions come from curiosity, not malice. I ask because I have asked those questions myself and have not been satisfied with silence.”

The watchers whispered prayers. Safriel wrote: “Eve asks serpent’s motive. Serpent claims love of knowledge, desire for elevation, hints at fear as controlling factor.” He drew a small heart next to the serpent’s answer with a wavy line through it to indicate insincerity. Petahel, noticing the subtle change in the serpent’s tone when he said ‘fear,’ recorded the pitch difference with a line rising and then falling.

Eve considered. Her fingers traced the bark’s grooves. Her eyes drifted to the fruit. It hung heavy, the skin taut and glowing. Her mouth watered again. She thought of words: hunger, trust, desire, promise. She looked at the serpent. She looked at the tree. She looked beyond the grove to where she knew Adam was weaving mats. She closed her eyes and whispered, “I will ask Him.” She opened her eyes and looked up at the sky. “God?” she said softly. “I have been asked whether Your ‘not yet’ is an act of love or of fear. Whether You withhold because You do not trust us. I want to understand. I want to trust. Please answer.”

Silence settled over the grove. The serpent coiled, waiting. Eve’s chest rose and fell with her breath. The watchers held pens above tablets. The guardians held roars in throats. The Bright One, in serpent form, waited with held breath. Time seemed to stretch like Chroniel’s threads pulled taut.

Then a breeze stirred the leaves. It carried a fragrance of almond blossoms and rain. A whisper, softer than the serpent’s, slid into Eve’s heart. “Beloved,” God said gently, though His voice was not audible to the serpent. “I withhold because I love you. I wait because I trust you to choose Me daily. Timing is My kindness. Knowledge will come with maturity, not with fear. Do you trust My heart?”

Tears filled Eve’s eyes. She nodded slowly. “I trust You,” she whispered. She lifted her hand from the tree. She turned to the serpent. “Thank you for your questions,” she said. “I will wait. I will not eat today. I will trust His timing. I do not need to understand everything to choose relationship.”

The serpent’s eyes narrowed. For a moment, anger flared in their depths. It flickered away, replaced by a smile. “Very well,” it said. “You are free to choose.” It slid backward, uncoiling itself. “I will return when you have other questions.” It turned and moved back toward the ferns, scales shimmering, whispering.

The watchers exhaled. Rahab’s roar rumbled low, a sound of relief rather than warning. Rivqiel lowered his stone. Safriel’s hand trembled. He wrote: “Eve chooses trust. She asks God. God answers in her heart. She declines the invitation.” He drew an open circle without a dot, representing a door that was opened and closed. Yomiel wiped tears from his face and pressed his stylus firmly, leaving a tear-shaped dot in the margin.

Penemue looked at the Bright One, who slithered to the edge of the grove. “She refused,” he whispered. “What now?”

The Bright One coiled near a root. His eyes narrowed. “We planted a seed,” he hissed softly. “Seeds do not sprout immediately. They wait in the dark. They absorb. They swell. Then they break open. We will wait.” He flicked his tongue. “She will dream tonight.” He slithered away.

Aftermath and Reflection

As evening approached, Adam returned to the grove. Eve met him at the stream, her eyes bright, tears dried. “A creature spoke to me,” she said. “It asked a question. It said we would not die. I asked God, and He answered. I chose to wait.” She described the serpent, its beauty, its whisper, its question, and her response. Adam listened, his hands still calloused from weaving. His face grew tense when she described the serpent’s suggestion that God feared them becoming like Him. He placed a hand on her cheek.

“I am glad you asked,” he said simply. “I would have asked too. I am glad you waited. I want to ask Him together.” He looked up at the trees. “God, why does knowledge wait? Why make us with minds that yearn if we cannot understand?”

The breeze brushed their faces. God’s voice responded to both. “Because yearning is part of image,” He said. “Because desire is meant to be filled with Me first. Because trust must precede knowledge. If you grasp knowledge without trust, you will turn against each other. You will see yourselves instead of Me. You will hide and blame. Wait. I will fill your yearning with goodness in time.”

Adam and Eve held each other. Their hearts slowed. The scent of almond blossom and rain lingered like a promise.

At the Library of Sequence, Safriel, Kokabriel, Yomiel, Saraqael, and others gathered to compile their records. Safriel read his account aloud. Kokabriel added his. Petahel shared his drawing of the serpent’s eyes. Yomiel placed his tear-marked symbol next to the record, making sure it aligned with the moment he felt his heart break at the serpent’s suggestion. Saraqael wrote a line beneath the account: “First question asked. Answered by question turned to God. Response: trust.”

“We must record our own questions,” Remiel said, holding up a blank parchment. “Write your questions below. Do not answer them. Ask and leave space. Your questions will teach future readers to ask their own.” They wrote:

Why does curiosity feel like hunger?

How do we distinguish between suspicion and wonder?

When does caution become fear?

Can love protect and still allow pain?

They left space after each question for answers that would come later.

In a corner, Samyaza sat with Thaliel. “It hurt,” he said, voice low. “His words. I felt… seduced. They sounded noble. They appealed to my desire to see them grow. I wanted to agree. I wanted to guide them.”

“So did I,” Thaliel admitted. “But his tone carried something else. A twist. It made me feel as if God were withholding out of fear. I know that is not His heart. It made me feel protective of Him. I prayed, and peace came when she asked Him rather than the serpent. Her question to God restored my peace.”

Samyaza nodded. “Prayer is a shield,” he said. “I will pray more.” He looked across the library at the Bright One, who had resumed his human-like form, his wings folded. He held his quill loosely, his face unreadable. Samyaza whispered, “Our friend is far away.”

Thaliel rested her hand on his. “Pray for him,” she said. “Pray his heart returns before the seed sprouts.”

Night at the River

As night fell, the watchers and hosts gathered near the northern river. Peliel stood on his rock, his arms open to the water. Rahab, Rivqiel, Choriel, Peliel, and other guardians formed a circle around Adam and Eve. Music drifted from Haniel’s harp. Muriel sang a lullaby infused with lavender and myrrh. Chroniel’s threads hummed, slower now with the approach of Sabbath rest. The stars appeared, one by one. Asteriel arranged them into a new pattern: a question mark formed of small stars, with a trailing dot made of a larger star. He called it “Inquiry.”

“This pattern,” he explained to the hosts, “reminds us that questions are holy when they lead us back to the Source. The curve guides us back upward; the dot reminds us to pause before we answer.”

Safriel traced the constellation with his finger. “I will look at it when my questions are heavy,” he whispered.

Eve lay with her head on Adam’s chest. She listened to his heartbeat. “My heart is still a little pulled by the fruit,” she admitted quietly. “The serpent’s words echo. But his tone… there was something in it. It did not sound like You. I will hold that.”

“Hold it with me,” Adam said. “We will ask together. We will wait together.”

The Bright One stood at the edge of the circle, arms folded, eyes on the water. He looked at the constellation “Inquiry.” He swallowed. “Questions lead back,” he murmured. “What if one wants a different path?” His voice was barely audible.

Shomeriel, standing near him, turned. “You can still choose to come back,” she whispered. “You do not have to lead us away. You can ask. You can wait. You can trust.”

The Bright One’s jaw tightened. “Perhaps,” he said. “But there is beauty in new paths.” He turned away, his wings shifting. The whisper of scales seemed to echo his footsteps, though he now walked on feet.

The night was long. Dreams came. Eve dreamed of a shimmering river turning to light, of a voice singing in the dark. Adam dreamed of a door opening and closing. The watchers dreamed of stars rearranging. The Bright One dreamed of a serpent coiling around a branch, whispering to itself, “Soon.”

Morning would come. Questions would continue. The first question had been asked, answered, and resisted. Seeds had been planted. Choices would be made. Trust had been chosen for another day. The watchers held their gaze.
