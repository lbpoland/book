Chapter 2 — First Orientation
Dawn and Dreams

Adam’s first night as a living being had ended in sleep that held him like soft arms. The breath given to him continued its steady rhythm as he lay on the grass mat, his chest rising and falling in unison with Nefeshiel’s hum. Dreams came, though he had no word for them. Images drifted across the inner canvas of his mind: colours swirling like the sky he had seen, a sensation of another hand touching his hand—smaller, softer, warm—then leaving. He saw a grove of trees heavy with fruit he had not yet tasted, light bouncing off leaves like laughter. He saw a shape moving in the shadow of those trees—long, low, shimmering like wet stone—and heard a voice that did not move its mouth but spoke in riddles. He did not understand the words, only the tug they created in his belly. In one image he walked beside someone who looked like himself but different, and he felt the feeling of belonging. In another he reached out to take fruit, then saw the face of God and felt both delight and caution. The images slid away like mist when he stirred, leaving the impressions of warmth, curiosity, and a hint of ache. They did not impose commands. They invited questions.

When Auriel’s blush began to colour the eastern edge of the sky, the valley stirred. Birds perched in the almond tree twitched and fluffed feathers. Matariel let a faint dew settle again, and the scent of earth rose. God sat beside Adam, having watched him through the night. There was no impatience in God’s posture, only a deep attentiveness that had not diminished through hours of stillness. When Adam opened his eyes at the touch of light on his face, they found God’s face first. For a moment, Adam simply looked, as if confirming that the voice he had heard in the dark and the hands he had felt were indeed tied to the face before him.

“Good morning,” God said. The words were both greeting and blessing, but for Adam the phrase carried little meaning beyond the warmth in the tone. He lifted his hand and rubbed his eyes, feeling the coarse texture of his eyelashes against his fingertips. “Morn—ing?” he repeated, tasting the word slowly. The consonants felt different in his mouth than the open vowels of his own name. He liked the way they made his tongue press behind his teeth.

“Morning is when the light returns,” God explained. “It is the beginning of day. We will walk when the light is higher. Did you rest?”

Adam thought. His mind had been full of pictures. “I saw … pictures,” he said haltingly, using the word for what his eyes did when open to describe what happened while they were closed. “My eyes were closed, but I saw. Another hand … like mine. And a tree … and …” He struggled to describe the shimmering shape in the shadow. He pointed with his hand, then drew a line in the air. “Long. Like … river? But not water.” He looked at God, questioning.

“Those are called dreams,” God said, nodding. “They come when you sleep. Dreams are invitations, not commands. Sometimes they are reflections of what is inside you; sometimes they show you something that will come; sometimes they show you something that will not come but that you need to consider. They are pictures for your heart to ponder. If you see something that confuses or delights you in dreams, bring it to Me. We will talk about it. I will never hide from you.”

Adam’s brow furrowed. “Who was the hand?” he asked softly. “It felt … like me. But smaller.”

God’s eyes softened. “In time, you will meet another like yourself,” He replied. “For now, trust the unfolding. Today is about your body and this place. There will be time for more.”

Adam nodded, though a yearning had already taken root. The dream of someone like him did not feel like hunger or thirst—it was more a pull, a recognition that his existence was incomplete without a counterpart. He touched his chest with his palm and felt the steady beat under his skin. “My chest … bump,” he said. “Inside. It is … sound.”

“That is your heart,” Raphael answered, stepping closer at God’s gesture. The healer spoke slowly, watching Adam’s eyes to ensure he was not overwhelmed. “Your heart beats. It moves blood through your body. Blood carries life to every part of you. When you are calm, it beats slowly. When you run or when you feel strong feelings, it will beat faster. You do not need to control it. It will teach you to listen. When it beats very fast and you are at rest, ask for help.”

Adam placed his other hand on his chest, feeling the rhythm. “Heart,” he repeated, pressing gently. “Heart.” He smiled at the word and at the feeling of movement that was not under his control. “Raphael,” he said after a moment, repeating the healer’s name, trying it on his tongue. Raphael’s face lit up. “Yes,” he said, bowing slightly. “I am Raphael. I am a healer. I will help you when your body is hurt or sick, but only if you want help. May I tell you something about movement?”

Adam nodded, curiosity sparking. He sat up slowly, pushing with his hands. His abdominal muscles trembled with the effort. “It feels … heavy,” he said. “My stomach. My legs.”

“You have lain still,” Raphael explained. “Your muscles are tight. Movement warms them. Stretch. Reach. Breathe deeply.” Raphael lifted his own arms overhead and inhaled slowly to demonstrate. Adam imitated, raising his arms, fingers splayed, stretching until he felt the pull in his shoulders. He inhaled deeply, his ribs expanding. He exhaled, and a sound came out—a sigh. He laughed at the unexpected sound. “That is called a sigh,” Gabriel said quietly. “It is a breath with feeling in it. You sigh when you feel relief or sadness or even tiredness.”

Adam rotated his shoulders and wiggled his fingers. He placed his hands on the ground behind him and pushed himself awkwardly to his knees. For a moment, he balanced there, unsure. “Hands and knees,” he murmured, labelling his posture without realising he was naming. He moved one leg forward and placed his foot under his body. It took effort to lift his weight. He grunted, something between laughter and strain. God put His hand out but did not touch. “May I steady you?” He asked. Adam looked at the hand, weighed his own desire, then nodded. God placed His palm lightly against Adam’s back—not pushing but offering balance. With a strained sound and a grin, Adam pushed with his foot and stood.

The world changed again. The perspective from standing made everything both closer and further. The ground beneath his feet felt uneven, yet firm. The river shimmered in the distance. Trees towered. The hosts looked taller, though some of the smaller angels, like Floriel and Zaphiel, were still at eye level. Adam swayed. “My head … spin,” he said, closing his eyes. “My feet … feel everything.” He lifted one foot and then the other. The grass tickled the soles. Small stones pressed into his skin. “Ouch?” he exclaimed, looking down. He hopped on one foot, then laughed at himself. “Ouch is when something hurts but does not harm you,” Sofiel supplied, watching closely. “Pain is a message from your body. It tells you to notice. If you listen, you learn. If you ignore, pain can become harm.”

“Ouch,” Adam repeated, smiling. He let his foot down carefully, choosing a spot with more grass. Haptiel crouched and brushed away a small pebble. “May I move this?” he asked. Adam nodded. “Yes. Thank you.” Haptiel smiled. “Thank you for letting me. This is how we will help each other. We will ask. You will answer. Sometimes you will ask, and we will answer. It is good.”

Michael stepped forward a pace, his posture both protective and relaxed. He did not tower; he did not impose. “My name is Michael,” he said. “I am a guardian. I stand against things that seek to destroy. I will not control you. I will not stop you from learning. But if something tries to kill you, I will stand between. May I walk beside you today as you explore?”

Adam looked at Michael’s broad shoulders and steady eyes. He nodded. “Yes. Walk. With me.” He reached out his hand to Michael, then paused, remembering God’s earlier question. “May I hold your … arm?” he asked. It was his first time seeking consent. Michael’s eyes shone. “You may,” he said. Adam gripped Michael’s forearm. The touch was firm. Strength radiated through Michael’s skin, but it did not overwhelm. It reassured Adam that falling would not mean being alone.

Feeling Hunger, Thirst, and Taste

As they began to walk slowly, placing one foot in front of the other, Adam’s stomach made a noise. It rumbled like a distant thunder. He stopped, eyes wide, and put his hand on his belly. “What was that?” he asked, laughing nervously.

“That is hunger speaking,” God answered, stepping beside him. “Your body needs energy. Hunger is a voice that says, ‘I need to eat.’ You do not need to be ashamed of hunger. It is good. It will remind you to ask and to receive. When you feel hunger, bring it to Me. I will show you what to eat. Not everything that is beautiful is good to eat, and not everything that is plain is bad. Ask, and you will learn.”

Adam nodded slowly, pressing his hand to his belly. The sensation was strange but not painful. It was more like emptiness drawing him toward fulfillment. “May I eat now?” he asked. God smiled. “Yes. There is a tree nearby with fruit that will give you strength and joy without harming you. Michael, will you show him?”

Michael led Adam to a small tree with branches bent low under the weight of red and gold fruit. The fruit smelled sweet, tangy, and rich. Naschiel inhaled deeply and sighed. “This tree is called pomegranate,” she said. “Its fruit is full of seeds. Its flesh is sweet and tart. You may eat.”

Adam reached up, but his balance wavered. He looked at God, then at Michael. “May I?” he asked, pointing. God nodded. “Yes.” Adam grasped the fruit. The skin was smooth and cool. He pulled. It resisted slightly, then released with a pop that made him laugh. He brought the fruit to his nose first. He inhaled. Scent flooded him: sweetness, freshness, the promise of juice. His mouth watered. He bit tentatively. The skin resisted, then broke, releasing a gush of ruby juice that spilled down his chin. The taste exploded on his tongue. Sweet, sour, bitter, complex. He gasped and then laughed as he chewed. The seeds crunched gently between his teeth. The juice dribbled onto his chest. He looked down at the stain, eyes wide. “Red,” he said, touching the juice. “Red.”

Floriel clapped her hands softly, delighted by his spontaneous naming of colour. Ophiel stored the moment, noting that Adam named colour after tasting it. “Red can mean many things,” Uriel said quietly. “It is the colour of blood, of clay, of certain fruits. You have named a colour by its taste. This is wonderful.” He would later teach Adam the names for other colours, but for now, the association of red with the taste of pomegranate made perfect sense.

As Adam finished the fruit, juice dripping down his chin and onto his fingers, he felt a warmth spread through his body. The rumbling in his stomach quieted. He licked his fingers, savouring every last drop. “Delicious,” he said, the new word tasting almost as good as the fruit. “Delicious means it feels good to taste,” Gabriel explained. “Some things will taste bitter or sour, and those flavours will teach you different lessons. But sweet teaches gratitude.”

Raphael stepped forward with a small cloth woven by Aspheriel and offered it. “May I wipe your chin?” he asked. Adam considered, then nodded. Raphael dabbed the juice away. The gesture was tender, not servile. “Thank you,” Adam said. He then looked at the sticky cloth. “Sticky,” he observed, pressing his fingers together. “Sticky is when things cling. It can be good or annoying. We will show you how to wash later,” Haniel said, smiling.

Soon, thirst spoke. The dryness returned to his throat after the sweet fruit. “Water?” he asked, looking around. Matariel stepped forward, mist still clinging to her hair. “Come,” she said, leading him to a small stream. The water gurgled over stones, clear and cold. “This is moving water,” she said. “You may drink. Bend down. Cup your hands.” She demonstrated. Adam knelt, then placed both palms together, forming a shallow bowl. He dipped his hands into the stream, feeling the cold bite. He gasped. “Cold,” he said. He lifted the water to his mouth, spilling half of it. The water rushed over his tongue and down his throat, chasing away the stickiness. He sighed contentedly.

“Water will teach you rhythm,” Matariel continued. “It flows; it retreats; it waits in pools. Do not take too much at once. Sip. Allow your body to tell you when it is enough. When you thirst, ask. I will show you where water is good. Some water is not for drinking. You will learn.”

Adam nodded. He looked at the water swirling around the stones. He touched one stone, feeling its smoothness, then another with moss and slime, feeling its slipperiness. He laughed as his fingers slid. “Slippery,” he said. Haptiel grinned. “Yes. Slippery teaches caution. It makes you slow down. Not all fast movement is safe. Slippery invites careful steps.”

Hearing the World

After eating and drinking, Adam felt both warm and curious. Sounds began to stand out. Birds chirped overhead in different pitches. The river gurgled, sometimes loud, sometimes soft. Leaves rustled. His own breathing and heartbeats formed a backdrop. Eariel stepped closer, her body shimmering like ripples on water. “Would you like to hear?” she asked. Adam looked puzzled. “I hear,” he said. “Yes. Hear. But… different things?”

“Yes,” Eariel replied. She knelt down so that her face was level with his. “Close your eyes, if you wish, and I will make sounds. You will learn to distinguish them. Sound tells you where you are, what is coming, and sometimes what is inside you. When you hear, ask: What is this? Where is it? How should I respond?”

Adam closed his eyes. He listened. Eariel clapped her hands softly together. A sharp sound. Adam jumped slightly, then smiled. Eariel hummed low and long, like Nefeshiel’s hum but thinner. It vibrated in Adam’s chest. He placed his hand over his heart. “Warm,” he whispered. Eariel clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. A clicking, staccato sound. Adam laughed. “Funny,” he said. She then whistled, high and sustained. The pitch made his ears buzz. He winced. “High. Ear tickle.”

“You can tell me to stop,” Eariel said gently. “Not all sounds are good for you. You may say, ‘No, thank you.’”

Adam nodded. “No, thank you,” he repeated, placing his hand over his ear. Eariel stopped the whistle. “Well done,” she said. “Now listen to yourself.” Adam tilted his head. He inhaled loudly through his nose. The air whooshed. He exhaled with a hum. “Hmm,” he said. “That is my voice.” Eariel smiled. “It is. Your voice will change when you whisper, speak, laugh, or shout. Listen to it. It will teach you about your feelings. When you speak, others hear your intentions. Think before you speak. Words have weight.” Adam nodded. He repeated, “Words have weight.”

Gabriel stepped in. “I am Gabriel,” he said. “I will bring words from God to you and from you to God and sometimes to others. My gift is precision. If you do not understand something, you may ask me to explain. But first, always listen to God. I do not speak on my own.”

Adam nodded. “Gabriel,” he said, carefully forming the name. He liked the shape of it: the soft “Ga,” the roll of “bri,” the closing “el.” He repeated it, then smiled. “It tastes like… water.” They all laughed softly at the synesthesia of a new mind.

Sight and Colour

After hearing, Ophiel resumed the lesson of sight. She waved her hand in front of Adam. “There are colours you have not yet named,” she said. “Do not rush to name them. Experience them. Let them speak to you. Come with me.” She led him a few steps until they reached a patch of flowers that Floriel had planted near the grove: blue irises, yellow daisies, purple asters, red poppies. The colours were intense in the morning light. Adam gasped. “Beautiful,” he whispered, using his word from the night before. He knelt down, bringing his face near a blue iris. He touched the petal. It was soft and cool. He pressed it lightly. It yielded and then sprang back. He looked at his fingers. No juice stained them. He glanced at the yellow daisy. He noticed tiny filaments at the centre that looked like the seeds in his pomegranate. He brought his nose close and inhaled. A faint sweetness. He looked at the purple flower. He stuck out his tongue. “No taste,” he said, disappointed. Naschiel chuckled. “Not everything is for eating. Some things are for smelling, seeing, touching. Resist putting everything in your mouth.”

Ophiel sat beside him. “Colours carry feelings,” she said. “Blue can calm. Yellow can cheer. Green invites you to rest your eyes. Red calls attention. Purple humbles. When you look at colours, notice how your body responds. These responses are gifts. They can also mislead if you do not test them. Do not assume that everything red is sweet or that everything white is safe. Ask. Listen. Experience. Then name.”

Adam nodded, letting the colours wash over him. He did not yet feel compelled to name them. He simply experienced them as variations of “beautiful.” Ophiel smiled, seeing restraint. “Good,” she said. “Let beauty speak before you speak about beauty.”

Smell and Memory

Naschiel stepped forward next, carrying a small bundle of herbs and flowers. “Smell invites memory,” she said, offering a sprig of rosemary. “Here. Breathe in.” Adam leaned in and sniffed. His nostrils flared. The scent of rosemary was sharp, almost medicinal. It made him think of the clay and basil of the breathing moment, though they were different. Tears welled up unexpectedly. “Why?” he asked, wiping his face. “Why does smelling make water come?”

“Smell is connected to memory and feeling,” Naschiel explained gently. “When you smell, it reaches a deep part of you. It will remind you of moments, even if you cannot speak them. It is normal to feel tears. They can mean joy, sorrow, or awe. Do not be ashamed of tears. They are honest.” She handed him a sprig of mint next. “Try this.” He smelled. It was fresh and cool. It made his mouth water again. He smiled. “I like,” he said. “Like water but not water.” Naschiel nodded. “Yes. Mint refreshes. It can clear your mind. Sage can steady it. Lavender can calm. Fragrance is a tool. Use it wisely. Some smells will warn you. Some will tempt you. Always ask, ‘What is this smell teaching?’ before you follow it.”

Saraqael, listening, scribbled: smell invites memory; tears at rosemary; he likes mint; note caution about temptation. Kokabriel pressed a leaf of rosemary between two pages to capture the scent for later. Yomiel drew a wavy line above the note to indicate tears during smell.

Movement and Balance

After the senses, it was time to move. God led Adam to a flat clearing with a soft slope. “You will learn to walk, then run, then climb,” He said. “But do not rush. Movement is prayer. It is a way to honour the body I have given you. Each movement can be a question: ‘May I go here?’ Each step can be trust: ‘Will the ground hold me?’”

Adam placed one foot ahead of the other, leaning forward slightly. He stumbled. Michael reached out, but Adam waved him back. “I try,” he said. He placed his foot more carefully, feeling the ground with his toes. He shifted his weight. He lifted his other foot. He wobbled. He took a step. Then another. He laughed, delighted, as he moved forward. After a few steps, he tried to go faster. He leaned too far forward and his foot caught on a tuft of grass. He stumbled and fell, skin scraping his knee on a small rock.

Pain shot up his leg—a sharp sting that made him inhale sharply and then hold his breath. Raphael winced, but he did not rush. “Pain,” Adam gasped, pressing his hand to his knee. “Hurts.” His eyes filled with tears, but this time not from smell. “It burns.”

“That is pain,” Sofiel said, kneeling beside him but not touching yet. “It teaches. It shows you that your skin is open. It tells you to slow. It also tells us to tend. May I look at your knee?” she asked. Adam nodded, tears streaking his cheeks. He removed his hand. A small scrape bled, red seeping like pomegranate juice. Haemiel leaned forward. “That is blood,” he explained. “It carries life through your body. When it leaves, your body calls to heal. We will clean and cover it.”

Sofiel took a clean cloth and dipped it into the stream. “This might sting,” she warned. “Sting is sharp pain that ends quickly. May I touch?” Adam braced himself and nodded. She dabbed the cut. He hissed, then exhaled. The water washed away dirt and blood. Sofiel gently blew on it. “Air cools,” she said. She then took a leaf from a nearby plant, crushed it between her fingers, and let the juice drip onto the scrape. “This is comfrey,” she explained. “It helps the skin close. Do you feel better?” Adam sniffled and nodded. “Better,” he said. “Thank you. Pain … scary. But now less.”

“Pain warns,” Raphael said. “But fear can magnify pain. If you trust, pain teaches without crushing. In time, you will learn the difference between pain that teaches and harm that must be stopped. If you are unsure, ask.”

Adam looked down at the small cut. “Will it stay?” he asked. “No,” Sofiel replied. “The skin will heal. It may leave a mark for a while. A mark can remind you. Scars are not shame. They can be memory.” She placed a strip of woven fiber loosely over the scrape. “This keeps dirt out. You may remove it later.”

He nodded. He stood slowly and took another step. This time he watched where he placed his feet. He felt the ground with his toes. He found his balance. “Walking is trust,” he said aloud, echoing God’s earlier words. “Trust ground. Trust breath. Trust pain.” The hosts smiled at his ability to integrate lessons quickly.

Introducing the Orders

As midday approached and the sun warmed the valley, God gathered a small group near Adam: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Saraqael, Haniel, and the Bright One. “Adam,” God said, “you will live in relationship. You will not be alone. These are some of those who will walk with you.”

God gestured to Michael first. “Michael is a guardian,” He said. “He has already spoken with you. He will protect life but not control your choices.” Michael bowed slightly and spoke again, “I will stand between you and death. If danger comes that you do not yet see, I will warn you. If you choose to ignore, I will grieve but not force. My presence is mercy, not confinement.” Adam nodded.

Gabriel stepped forward. “I am a messenger,” he said. “My gift is words. I will carry God’s messages to you and, if you ask, your messages to others. I will speak plainly and with love. If something I say confuses you, ask me to clarify. I will not speak unless sent.”

Raphael took his turn. “I am a healer. I will tend your body. Pain and sickness will come. They will teach, but they need not overwhelm. I will ask before I touch. I will wait if you say no. Healing is as much about presence as it is about remedy.”

Uriel stepped up. “I am an illuminator,” he said. “I help minds see truth. I will shine light into questions and help you understand parables and laws. I will not force understanding. If you do not wish to see, I will wait until you ask.”

Saraqael bowed. “I am a watcher,” he said. “I record what happens. I write and draw and note fragrance and sound so that memory is preserved. I will not interfere without invitation. If you wish your name left out of a record, I will honour that. I record for truth and trust, not for power.”

Haniel smiled widely. “I am an angel of joy and music,” he said. “I bring songs. I will teach you to dance and sing and let your body worship. Music will help your heart feel things that words cannot. I will not force a song into your ears. When you are ready, we will sing together.”

Finally, God gestured to the Bright One. The Bright One inclined his head slightly, his expression composed. “I am called many names,” he said, his voice smooth as polished stone. “Many call me the Morning Star or the Bright One. I have led songs and councils. I have studied law and light and secrets. I am here. I watch. I serve. If you have questions about beauty or order, you may ask. I will answer as truthfully as I know how.” His eyes flickered toward God and then back to Adam. “Welcome, Adam,” he added. His voice was warm, but there was a sheen of control over it, like oil on water.

Adam looked at him, drawn by the radiance and by something else he could not name. “Bright One,” he said slowly. “You are… bright. Like sun. But different. Thank you.” The Bright One inclined his head again. Inside, a seed of comparison stirred. He had once been the sole focus of attention when new beings were brought forth. Now he stood in line, introducing himself after others. He felt a pang and smoothed it over. Not yet, he thought. Not here. He clasped his hands behind his back.

Meeting Other Creatures

After the introductions, God led Adam to a meadow where animals grazed peacefully. “These are creatures,” God said. “They are alive. They do not have your kind of breath, but they move and eat and make sounds. You will name them later. For now, meet them. See how they move and make sounds. Learn gentleness.”

A doe lifted her head from grazing when Adam approached. Her ears flicked. Her nostrils flared. Adam extended his hand slowly, palm open, as he had seen God do. The deer stepped forward cautiously and sniffed his fingers. Her warm breath tickled his skin. He laughed softly. “Soft,” he said. He ran his fingers along her neck, feeling the smooth fur. The deer relaxed and pressed into his palm. “She trusts you,” Michael murmured. “Gentleness invites trust.”

Next, a lamb tottered over on small legs. It bleated high and insistent. Adam knelt. The lamb sniffed his knee, licked the sticky stain of pomegranate juice, and bleated again. Adam laughed, wiping his knee with the cloth Raphael had given him. “Hungry?” he asked the lamb. Haniel chuckled. “She thinks you are sweet.” The lamb butted his hand gently. “She teaches play,” Raphael said. “Play is how you learn balance and strength without fear.”

An eagle circled overhead and then landed on a branch, watching with keen eyes. A fox darted through the grass in the distance. Rabbits emerged from burrows. Each creature moved with its own rhythm. Some came near; others kept distance. Adam watched and mimicked some of their movements, crouching like the fox, stretching like the cat. He laughed when he could not move as fluidly as they did. “They do this without thinking,” he observed, panting. “They just are. I have to think.”

“They have patterns,” Uriel said. “They do not choose in the way you choose. They follow instinct—the law woven into their bodies. You have will. You can imitate or you can create. This is a gift and a burden. Instinct protects and limits. Choice frees and demands responsibility.”

As they spent time with the creatures, the Bright One stood at a slight remove. He watched Adam’s interactions with the deer, the lamb, the fox. He noted Adam’s laughter, the way his face lit up when the lamb licked him, the way he frowned in concentration when he tried to imitate the cat’s posture. He leaned toward Gadreel. “Look,” he whispered. “He is like the creatures and unlike them. He has curiosity, and he imitates. If we can guide what he imitates, we can guide him.” Gadreel nodded slowly, eyes narrowing. “Curiosity is a door,” he agreed. “We will knock.”

Samyaza overheard and sighed. “Why not just serve?” he whispered back. “Is not his delight enough for us to share?” The Bright One’s jaw tightened. “Delight is fine,” he replied quietly, “but what is delight without direction? Chaos. We were given to direct.” He turned his gaze back to Adam, who was now laughing as a rabbit sniffed his hair.

Trust and Relationship

As the sun began its descent, Heliel’s light mellowed. God led Adam to a large stone. They sat together. The stone was warm from the afternoon heat. Adam placed his hand on it, feeling the stored warmth. “Stone,” he said. “Warm stone.” God nodded. “Stone holds heat. It is steady. It does not move unless moved. It will teach you consistency. You may sit here whenever you wish to talk.”

Adam looked at God’s face, studying its lines. He reached up and touched his own cheek, feeling the smoothness of his skin. He then touched God’s beard lightly. “Different,” he said. “Hair.” God chuckled. “Yes. Hair grows. Yours will too. You will learn to care for it. Hair can be adorned, cut, braided. It does not define your worth.”

“Am I like you?” Adam asked suddenly, pressing his palm to God’s cheek. God closed His eyes at the touch. “You are like Me in ways that are deeper than what you see,” He replied. “You carry My image: You can choose, love, create, steward, and represent Me. You are dust and spirit, body and breath. You are not Me. You will never be God. But you are like Me. Our relationship will teach you what that means. Listen. Ask. Trust.”

“Trust,” Adam repeated. “I trust. I …” He searched for a word. “I love?” He did not fully understand love, but the feeling in his chest when he said it felt similar to the warmth he experienced when God looked at him. God’s eyes softened. “Yes,” He said. “You love. Love is more than a word. It is your choice to give yourself to another’s good. You will learn love by loving and by receiving love. Let yourself be loved. Let yourself love.”

Adam nodded, tears filling his eyes again. He did not brush them away. He let them fall. They landed on the stone. The sun caught one tear, and it shimmered like the dew on the grass that morning. “Tears are not shame,” God said. “They are truth. They water your soul. They will water the ground. They will mix with joy and sorrow. Cry freely.”

Evening Song

As twilight drew near, Haniel glanced at God. God nodded. “A note only,” He said. Haniel drew his harp—a small instrument with strings made of light—and plucked a single note. It rang clear and pure, vibrating through the valley. The note resonated with Adam’s chest. He gasped at the vibration. The note did not overwhelm; it invited. Haniel looked at Adam and smiled. “This is a note,” he said. “Music is made of notes. Music speaks to places words cannot. When you are ready, you will sing and play. For now, listen.”

Haniel plucked another string, a slightly higher note. Seraphina hummed along, her voice weaving around the note like silk. The music grew slowly into a simple melody: three notes, then four, repeating, inviting. Adam closed his eyes and let the sound wash over him. His fingers tapped his leg in time. His heart matched the rhythm. He opened his mouth and sang a vowel sound—“Ahhh”—sustaining it as the melody continued. Haniel grinned. “You have sung your first note,” he said. “Well done.”

After the short song, Haniel lowered his harp. “Music is gift,” he said. “It can heal, mourn, celebrate. It must not manipulate. We will create songs together that invite and honour. Never use song to force or to deceive.” The Bright One’s eyes flicked toward Haniel. He remembered his own early songs and their power to move hearts. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.

Night and Reflection

Night fell fully. Luniel’s gentle glow rose, casting silver light on the valley. Stars appeared one by one, the Asterim placing them with care. Adam lay on the grass, staring up. The starfield seemed both distant and near. He reached out his hand, as if to touch a bright star. Asteriel approached slowly and lay beside him, pointing at a grouping of stars. “See those?” he whispered. “They form a shape like a gate. We call it The Gate. It reminds us that there are doors you will encounter—choices. Some doors lead to life, others to loss. You will learn to discern.” Adam nodded sleepily. “Gate,” he murmured. “Stars … gate.” He yawned. Sleep tugged at him. His eyes fluttered. He whispered, “Thank you,” not knowing to whom. Then he slept.

The Bright One remained standing, his face illuminated by starlight and moon. He watched Adam sleep. He leaned toward Penemue. “He trusts too easily,” he whispered. “Trust is dangerous when one does not know all the laws.” Penemue smirked. “Then we teach him more laws,” he said. “Or rather, we teach him the parts God leaves unsaid.” Gadreel chuckled quietly. “Omission is a powerful tool,” he murmured. Samyaza frowned. He looked at the sleeping man and then at the stars. “May I suggest prayer?” he whispered, almost to himself. “Prayer may change hearts—ours included.” The Bright One said nothing. His gaze drifted to the horizon, where darkness met dawn’s future blush. He was thinking of boundaries and freedom, of desire and law, of love and control. His silent calculus continued.

End of Day

As the night deepened, the hosts took turns keeping watch, not because they feared something would harm the man but because they honoured the gift before them. Guardians stood at the edge of the clearing, swords sheathed, eyes alert but not anxious. Healers rested their hands on their own hearts, listening to Adam’s breathing pattern as he slept. Watchers scribbled by the light of Luniel, not missing the slight changes in his breath when he dreamed again. Messengers whispered prayers for clarity. Illuminators contemplated the interplay of moonlight and shadow on his sleeping form, considering how to use such images to teach in the future. Musicians hummed quietly, their notes like incense rising.
