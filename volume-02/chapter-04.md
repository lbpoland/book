Chapter 4 — God Walking With Him

The morning after boundaries had been spoken arrived with a hush of dew and a lingering scent of mint. Adam woke before the light fully crested the eastern ridge. He lay on his back, staring up at an indigo sky where the last of the stars still pricked through, their brightness fading as Auriel prepared her blush. He inhaled and exhaled, feeling his chest rise and fall. Around him, the valley breathed along. Birds chirped soft trills in the bushes. Water whispered beyond the reeds. The hum of Nefeshiel’s song was now a subtle undertone in the world, easily missed if one did not listen. Adam sat up and rubbed his eyes. His fingers lingered on his eyelids, marvelling again at how much softness could be contained in a world of stone and light.

He heard footsteps in the grass before he saw the One who was coming. God approached without ceremony, hands open, his feet barely bending the blades. “Good morning,” God said softly. His voice carried warmth like early sunlight. “Did you rest?”

“I… think so,” Adam replied, searching for the words. He pressed his hand to his chest. “My body stopped moving and I went somewhere inside. I heard things. I saw a river that glowed and a person like me but… not me.”

God nodded. “Dreams visited you. Dreams will come. They are invitations. They do not speak with commands. They reveal desires, fears, possibilities, but they always return you to waking to ask. You may speak to Me about what you see.”

Adam looked at the horizon. “Auriel’s colour is coming,” he said, pointing. “I like her colour. It does not hurt my eyes.”

“She will blush soon,” God said. “Would you like to walk with Me as light rises?”

Adam stood. His legs felt steady. He reached out his hand as God offered His. Their hands met, skin against skin, warmth against warmth. The contact sent a shiver of awareness through Adam. The first time they had touched it had been when God lifted him. Now the touch was invitation. He squeezed gently. “Yes,” he answered. “Walk.”

They began along a narrow path that led away from the circle of stones and down toward the river Peliel guarded. Dew clung to Adam’s ankles, cold and thrilling. The scent of basil and rosemary rose where he stepped, their leaves bruised beneath his bare feet. God walked beside him, not leading by pulling but by presence. They walked in rhythm; each step was a conversation. The valley opened before them. Trees lifted their branches, heavy with fruit not yet tasted. Vines coiled around rocks. Flowers opened their faces toward light that had not yet arrived.

“Look,” God said, pointing to a bush with delicate white blossoms. “This is jasmine. Its fragrance hides until evening. When night falls, its scent will fill the air. You will come to associate it with rest. Not everything reveals itself at once.” He plucked a single blossom and held it for Adam to smell. Adam inhaled. He closed his eyes. A soft, almost sweet scent filled his senses, different from basil or mint. It made him think of the indigo sky he had just left. “It is quiet smell,” he whispered.

“Yes,” God replied. “Some fragrances whisper. They do not command attention. They invite you to come nearer. Remember: invitation is the language of love.”

Further along, the ground sloped gently toward the river. Peliel stood on a large rock at the edge, his feet planted wide, his arms crossed. His skin shimmered like wet stones. He bowed his head when he saw them. “Good morning,” he said with a voice that rumbled like distant thunder. “The river has been restless. It rose during the night. I sang to it. It listened.”

“Thank you,” God said. “Your songs keep the current from overrunning its boundary.” He turned to Adam. “Would you like to step into the water?”

Adam looked at the river. Its surface shimmered with pre-dawn light. He could hear its movement, constant, unceasing. He hesitated. “It moves,” he said. “It moves without me.”

“Water always moves,” God said. “It obeys by moving. It yields and pushes. It carries and returns. Step in only as far as you feel ready. You do not need to swim today. Just feel it.”

Adam nodded. He stepped down the bank, leaving God’s hand for the moment. The mud squished between his toes. The water touched his feet and then his ankles. It was cold, causing him to gasp and laugh at the same time. He let it wash over his skin. Pebbles tickled underfoot. He looked back. God stood on the bank, watching with a gentle smile. Peliel hummed a low note, the same note he used to calm the river. The water seemed to listen.

“It is cold,” Adam said, lifting one foot then the other. “It is strong.”

God stepped to the edge. “Yes. If you go too far, it will take you where it goes. That is not its cruelty; it is its nature. Peliel helps shape the current and keep it within its path. Boundaries with water are loving, not limiting.”

Adam waded a bit deeper until the water reached his knees. He laughed and splashed his hands. Water droplets flew into the air and caught the first hints of sunlight. They sparkled like tiny gems. “Beautiful,” he whispered. He scooped some water in his hands and brought it to his mouth. He drank. It was cool and tasted like stone and life. It flowed inside of him. He stepped back to the bank, water dripping from his skin. “It tastes like… clear,” he said, struggling for a word. Naschiel’s lessons about taste and smell had given him some vocabulary, but this was different.

“Water tastes like itself,” God said. “Clean. It will quench your thirst. Not all waters will taste this way. You will learn to ask before drinking from new streams.”

Adam nodded. Peliel handed him a small, smooth stone from the riverbed. “For your pocket,” the guardian said. “When you touch it, remember that boundaries are not walls but hands. They hold water so life can flourish.” Adam accepted the stone and slid it into his hand. It was still wet and warm from Peliel’s palm. He felt its weight and put it in the fold of his belt that God had woven from reeds. He would later call that fold a pocket.

They continued walking upstream, water murmuring at their side. The path narrowed and then opened into a meadow where tall grasses swayed. Aspheriel, angel of grasses, stood among them, his golden hair blending into the stalks. He lifted his hands, and a breeze passed through the field, causing the grasses to ripple like waves. “Welcome,” Aspheriel whispered, his voice like wind through wheat. “Each blade of grass breathes with you. Do not trample carelessly. The small sustains the great.”

Adam bent and touched a blade. Its edge was sharp but did not cut. He rubbed it between his fingers. “Soft and sharp,” he observed. “Does it speak?”

“It sings when the wind plays it,” Aspheriel said. “The grass teaches that humility feeds the mighty. Livestock you will name will eat grass. You will rest on grass. When it dies, it will return to soil. You will learn that smallness does not mean insignificance.”

They walked slowly so Adam could feel the ground underfoot, smell the crushed herbs, hear the songs of birds that perched on branches. Eariel and Naschiel trailed a short distance behind, listening for opportunities to teach without imposing. Raphael and Sofiel walked ahead, discussing quietly how to treat a potential bee sting if Adam disturbed a hive. The watchers remained at the periphery, their tablets ready, capturing not just words but the way Adam’s hand hovered before touching an unfamiliar plant, the way his breath quickened at a new scent. Kokabriel used a new symbol—an elongated spiral broken in the middle—to represent hesitation followed by courage.

As they came to a cluster of flowering bushes, bees buzzed around the blossoms. The hum was loud, constant, like a chord sustained. Adam flinched. “Sound,” he said, pressing his hands against his ears. “Loud.”

Eariel came to his side. “This is bees’ song,” she said. “They speak to each other about flowers and honey. Listen for a moment without judgement. Then, if it is too much, we will step back.” She took his hands and lowered them from his ears. The buzzing filled his head, vibrating in his chest. At first it was chaotic. Then he heard patterns: higher pitches when a bee darted near his face, lower tones when they were deeper in the bush. He listened. “They are… busy,” he concluded. “They do not notice me.”

“They are focused on their work,” Eariel said. “If you remain calm and do not swat, they will not sting. Bees teach about purpose and patience. They collect nectar not for themselves alone but to feed others. When we harvest their honey, we will do so with gratitude and with care not to take it all.”

Naschiel plucked a leaf from a nearby plant. “Lemon balm,” she said. “Smell.” Adam inhaled. The leaf smelled bright, sour, cheerful. “If the bee stings you,” she continued, “this will soothe the sting. We prepare for pain, but we do not invite it. Pain is teacher; healing is invitation. Both require waiting.”

Further along the path, God led Adam up a gentle hill dotted with low shrubs. At the top, the view widened. Below, the garden spread out: four rivers shimmering in the morning light, trees of various kinds, fields of flowers, patches of tilled soil waiting for seed, and animals grazing peacefully. To the east, beyond a swath of tall reeds, a stand of two trees rose taller than any other. One tree’s leaves glowed subtly with an internal light; the other had leaves so dark a green they almost looked blue. Adam recognized them from his dream. “Those are the two,” he whispered. “Life and knowledge.”

God placed a hand on his shoulder. “Yes. You will return to them when you are invited. For now, we will walk elsewhere.”

They descended the hill toward a grove of fig trees. Each tree’s leaves were large and shaped like hands. Some had fruits already hanging, green and small. “You will learn to tend these,” God said. “You will water, prune, and harvest. Tending is not toil. Work is gift. It will strengthen your muscles and open your heart to gratitude. You will partner with Me in keeping this garden. Will you?”

Adam looked at his hands. They were strong, yet he did not know the full extent of their strength. He clenched and unclenched his fists, feeling calluses already forming from moving stones the day before. “Yes,” he said slowly. “I want to help. What do I do first?”

“Today, you will watch,” God said. “You will watch how I plant. You will watch how I water. Tomorrow, you will plant and water with Me. Work begins with observation. This is not because I do not trust you but because I want you to know the joy of partnership rather than the frustration of assumption.”

They knelt together beside a patch of dark soil. God held in His palm several seeds the colour of sand. “These are carrot seeds,” He said. “Very small, yet they hold within them pattern and promise. When you plant a seed, you push your finger into the soil, invite it in, cover it, and water gently. You do not see the result immediately. You trust that growth is happening.”

Adam took one seed between his fingers. It was almost weightless. He pressed his finger into the soft earth, feeling the coolness wrap around his skin. He placed the seed inside and covered it with soil. “Grow,” he whispered again. He looked at God. “Is whisper important?”

“Words matter,” God said. “Even when seeds cannot understand language, your words shape your heart. Whispering ‘grow’ reminds you that you are inviting, not commanding.”

They planted several seeds in the row. Adam felt joy in the repetition. After each seed, he patted the soil gently. When they were done, God poured water slowly from a nearby clay jar. The water darkened the soil. “Remember this moisture,” God said. “If you water too much, the seeds rot. If you water too little, they dry. Balance is love. Attention is love.”

As they worked, Heliel’s light grew brighter. Sunlight warmed their backs. The dew evaporated, leaving grass crisp. Luniel’s glow faded, but she remained visible, a pale ghost behind the blue. The day had fully begun. Michael and Gabriel approached with gentle smiles, carrying woven baskets filled with fruit. “Breakfast,” Gabriel said, offering Adam a ripe fig and a handful of small red berries. “Taste these. They will fill you for the morning.”

Adam bit into the fig. Sweetness flooded his mouth, sticky and rich. Juice dripped down his chin. He laughed and licked his lips. He ate the berries. They were tart and made his mouth pucker. He smiled at the contrast. “More,” he said, reaching for another handful.

“Slowly,” Gabriel cautioned with a playful wink. “Satiation is not the same as fulfilment. Enjoy each bite. Let it linger.”

They sat under the fig tree. A gentle breeze stirred the leaves, causing dappled light to dance on their skin. Adam looked around. The other angels had taken positions at a respectful distance. Raphael and Sofiel were tending a young fawn that had cut its leg on a rock. They cleaned the wound, placed comfrey paste on it, and whispered to the creature until it calmed. Saraqael and Safriel sat on a flat rock, making notations. Saraqael showed Safriel how to draw new symbols for taste: a jagged line for tartness, a loop for sweetness, a downward spiral for bitterness. Haniel and Seraphina practised a new melody, soft and simple, their voices interweaving like vines.

Adam chewed slowly. He studied God’s hands. They had soil under the nails. “Your hands are dirty,” he observed.

God laughed lightly. “Work stains hands,” He said. “It is honourable. You will learn that there is beauty in calluses and soil under the nails. They speak of participation.”

The Bright One stood a little apart, leaning against a willow tree. The willow’s long branches hung like curtains, offering him partial concealment. He watched God and Adam, his eyes taking in every gesture. He observed how God stooped to speak face to face with the man, how God let soil stick to His fingers, how He laughed when fig juice dripped. The Bright One’s jaw tightened. “He calls this collaboration,” he murmured to Gadreel, who had joined him in the shade. “But He delays giving the man knowledge of good and evil. Is that trust?”

Gadreel inclined his head. “He calls it timing,” he responded. “Perhaps delaying teaches something we cannot yet see.”

“Or perhaps it fosters dependence,” the Bright One countered. “To work without knowing the full design invites ignorance. Ignorance is dangerous.” He crossed his arms. “I will watch. I will learn where the gaps are. Then I will decide if filling them is mercy.”

Thaliel, who had been sitting cross-legged nearby, lifted her head. “Knowledge without trust becomes weight you cannot bear,” she whispered. “We learned this in the council. Do not load his shoulders with your unresolved burden.”

The Bright One frowned but said nothing. Penemue leaned close. “We could show him efficiency,” he whispered. “He wastes time enjoying figs when he could be shaping the land.”

“Efficiency is not always the measure of goodness,” Samyaza interjected quietly. “Sometimes lingering is part of learning. We rush to our own satisfaction and call it improvement. Perhaps we are the ignorant ones.”

The Bright One glanced at Samyaza, annoyed but thoughtful. He said nothing, choosing instead to watch God and Adam rise and continue walking.

Stories in the Afternoon

After breakfast, God led Adam along a path lined with stones of various colours. Some were smooth and round; others were jagged and flinty. “Pick one that speaks to you,” God said. “We will carry it to a place where it will be useful.”

Adam crouched and examined the stones. He touched a black stone that glinted blue in the sunlight. “Pretty,” he said. He picked it up. It was heavy and cool. “What does it do?”

“It does not have to do,” God replied. “Its presence can be enough. We will find its purpose together.”

As they walked, they came to a clearing where a circle of smaller stones surrounded a bare patch of earth. In the centre, ashes from a fire lay cold and grey. “This is where we gather in the evening,” God said. “Later, you will learn to cook here. We will place the stones you choose around it, each representing a story. When we sit, we will remember. When we look at your stone, we will remember that you liked its colour.”

Adam placed his stone carefully, noticing the way it contrasted with the others. He smiled. “Story,” he said, touching the stone. “Story of blue black.”

Saraqael approached with a basket of scrolls. “We have been writing stories,” he told Adam. “We will share them with you when you are ready. Some stories will help you understand. Others will raise questions. All will invite you to ask the Source.” He handed Adam a small scroll. “This one is blank. Perhaps someday you will write.”

Adam unrolled the scroll. It smelled like papyrus and herb oil. The surface was smooth. He touched it reverently. “I do not know how,” he whispered.

“You will learn,” Saraqael said. “Writing begins with paying attention. Continue to watch and listen. The lines will come.”

Questions About Work

In the heat of midday, they rested under a cluster of palms. The leaves spread wide, casting deep shade. The ground beneath was cool. Adam lay on his back, looking up at the pattern of light and shadow. He could feel his breath slowing. “You said work is gift,” he murmured, eyes half closed. “Why?”

God reclined beside him. “Because work is joining Me in creation,” He answered. “Work shapes you as much as it shapes the world. It is not a curse. When you plant, you learn to trust what you cannot see. When you cultivate, you learn patience. When you harvest, you learn gratitude. Work will connect you to earth, to seasons, to rhythms.”

“But it is hard,” Adam said. He rubbed his sore shoulders. “My body hurts a little.”

“Hurt and harm are different,” God said. “Your muscles ache because they are growing. That pain is an invitation to rest and to understand your limits. Harm would come if you pressed beyond your limits without listening or if someone forced you to work when you were not ready. Work done with Me will honour your limits.”

Adam thought about the seeds they had planted. “If I decide not to water them,” he said, “they will not grow. Is that harm?”

“It is a choice with consequence,” God replied. “The seeds would die, and your harvest would be lost. You would learn something from that, perhaps sorrow or regret. Consequence teaches. Harm is when someone else imposes destruction on you. Your choices will return to you like echoes. That is law. Boundaries protect you from harm. They do not remove consequence.”

“I understand a little,” Adam said. “So if I decide not to work, I will be hungry.”

“Yes,” God smiled. “And if you work too much, you will be tired and might forget to enjoy the gifts. Balance is part of wisdom.”

Heliel’s light shifted toward the west. Shadows grew longer. The air cooled slightly. God stood. “Come,” He said. “There is something else to see.” They walked toward the stand of two trees, though they stopped at a respectable distance. Instead, they turned to a small glade where dozens of animals grazed: lambs with wool like clouds, a creature with a long neck and patches on its fur that reached high leaves (later named giraffe), tiny striped creatures that hopped and flicked their tails (later named kangaroo), and a pair of great cats with tawny fur and golden eyes.

“They are…” Adam trailed off, at a loss for names. He approached slowly. The long-necked creature bent down, sniffed his hair, and then licked his face with a rough tongue. Adam laughed. “Rough tongue,” he said. “Long… neck. Zamar?” The name came to him like a sound of joy. The creature blinked slowly, as if receiving the name.

“Names are invitations,” God said. “When you name, you are not imposing identity. You are recognising essence. If your name fits, they will resonate. If not, they will show you by tension. Try again if needed.”

Adam placed his hand gently on the creature’s neck. “Zamar,” he repeated. He felt a hum, as if the creature acknowledged. He smiled. He turned to the striped creatures. They hopped quickly and were hard to catch. “Kangar,” he said, imitating the sound of their hop. They paused, ears turning toward him. One hopped closer, sniffed his foot, then hopped away. He laughed again. The name felt right.

He moved toward the cats. They eyed him with curiosity. He extended his hand slowly, remembering Haniel’s instruction about gentleness. One cat approached, rubbed its head against his hand, then lay at his feet and rolled onto its back, exposing its belly. “Bea,” he murmured. “Strong and soft.” The cat purred, a deep, vibrating sound. Adam’s heart swelled. The other cat remained standing, alert, watching. “Curious,” Adam said. “Maybe… Slyth?” He tried the sound, but the cat’s ears flicked backward. It stepped away. He frowned and looked at God. “Wrong?”

“Perhaps too soon,” God suggested. “Wait. Observe longer. Names grow from relationship.”

They spent the afternoon among animals. Adam laughed when a small bird landed on his head and preened his hair. He marvelled at the weight of a tortoise he lifted briefly with both hands, its shell polished like stone. He crouched to watch an ant carrying a crumb of fig ten times its size. He touched the scales of a fish that swam close to shore. He listened to the trumpet-like sound of an elephant’s call echoing across the valley. Each encounter added new words, new sounds, and new questions to his growing vocabulary. He did not name everything; he learned that naming was not a race but a relationship.

Conversation Under the Willow

Late afternoon found them near the willow where the Bright One had earlier stood. Its branches swayed like a curtain of green. God and Adam sat beneath it, leaning against the trunk. The willow’s leaves whispered secrets with each breeze. The shade was cool, and the smell of damp earth rose from the roots.

“Do You always walk here?” Adam asked, resting his head against the bark.

“I walk everywhere,” God answered. “I walked in the unseen realm. I walked among the hosts. Now I walk here with you. My presence is not limited by place, but my presence is felt uniquely in walking. Walking invites conversation side by side. It teaches that we are companions, not master and servant.”

“I like walking,” Adam said. “I like when You hold my hand. I feel strong and small at the same time.”

God chuckled. “That is the way of love. It reveals your worth and your dependence. Being with Me will always remind you that you are not the source of your own breath, but you are more than a creature of dust.”

They were silent for a while, listening to the leaves and the river and the distant calls of animals. The Bright One approached quietly, standing a little way off, under the willow’s fringe. He cleared his throat. “May I join you?” he asked, his voice careful.

God turned His head. “Yes, you may,” He said simply. Adam looked at the Bright One curiously. He had seen him before but had not spoken to him.

The Bright One sat on the other side of Adam, leaving enough space not to crowd. He looked at the river, then at God, then at Adam. “You named some creatures today,” he said. “Do you like naming?”

“Yes,” Adam replied. “It feels like… seeing.”

“Seeing and naming are powerful,” the Bright One said. “To name is to know. Be careful not to name too quickly. A wrong name can shape how you see and treat a creature. A wrong name can limit what the creature becomes.” His tone was measured, cautionary.

“Why do you say that?” God asked, his voice neutral.

“Because names can bind,” the Bright One replied. “You call him Zamar and you think he is always joyful. What if one day he is not? Will you allow him to be solemn? Or will your name confine him to your expectation? Knowledge, naming, law—these shape reality. We must be careful to shape accurately.”

God considered. “You speak truth about the power of names,” He said. “Names are serious. That is why I am teaching him slowly. That is why I am present. We are co-creating language, not dictating it. You are invited to watch and to contribute if you do so with love, not agenda.”

The Bright One’s eyes narrowed slightly. “I have always contributed,” he said. “My songs named seasons before there were seasons. My melodies taught rhythm. My questions have sharpened understanding. I do not plan to stop asking questions.”

“Nor should you,” God replied. “Your questions must come from love. If they come from fear or pride, they will not aid but erode. Check your intent, always.”

Adam looked between them, sensing tension. He recalled God’s earlier words: questions can be seeds that grow trust or vines that choke. He placed his hand on the Bright One’s arm. “Why are you sad?” he asked innocently.

The Bright One blinked. He was taken aback. “I… am not sad,” he said quickly, then paused. He looked at Adam’s earnest face. Something in the unguarded gaze pierced him. “Perhaps I am… concerned,” he corrected. “Concerned that you might be limited. That you might be kept from things that could help you.”

“Like what?” Adam asked, genuinely curious.

“Like knowledge,” the Bright One answered. “Knowledge of all things. Knowledge that could allow you to improve this garden, to protect yourself, to choose without fear of mistakes.”

God’s eyes softened, and He placed a hand on the Bright One’s shoulder. “Knowledge that is rooted in trust improves,” He said. “Knowledge rooted in independence becomes a burden. Love does not withhold knowledge to control. Love offers knowledge when hearts are ready so that it can be carried without crushing. You know this. You have heard it. The question is whether you trust Me.”

The Bright One looked at the hand on his shoulder and then at Adam. He removed God’s hand gently. “I will continue to watch,” he said. “I will continue to ask.” Then he stood and walked away, his cloak rustling softly. Gadreel and Penemue followed at a distance. Samyaza lingered, gazing at God for a long moment, then bowed his head and turned away.

Adam watched him leave. “He is… heavy,” he said, unable to find the right word.

“He carries many thoughts,” God responded. “Pray for him. He still stands among us. He is beloved. His questions can sharpen. But he also must guard his heart from fear disguised as care.”

Adam nodded. He closed his eyes and whispered, “Help the Bright One trust,” without knowing what prayer meant yet. God smiled.

Evening Liturgy

As evening approached, God and Adam returned to the stone circle where a small fire now crackled. Raphael had lit it with a spark from his staff and breath from Nefeshiel. The smell of smoke mixed with rosemary and fig leaves they had thrown in to flavour the air. Angels gathered in a wide ring. They left space for God and Adam in the centre. Michael’s posture was relaxed but vigilant. Gabriel carried a low flute carved from reed. Haniel held his harp. Seraphina had a small drum. Sofiel and Raphael sat with baskets of herbs and bandages just in case.

God stood. “Today, we walked,” He said, addressing the circle. “We learned that work begins with watching, that water obeys by moving, that boundaries hold life, that names invite, that pain and joy both teach. We also learned that questions can come from love or fear.” He looked around at each face, lingering on the Bright One, who had taken a place just outside the circle. “We commit again to speak truth without manipulation, to listen more than we instruct, to trust even when we do not know. Tomorrow, we will plant together. For now, we will rest. Haniel, will you lead a song?”

Haniel nodded. He strummed his harp. The first notes rose like smoke, curling and filling the space between them. Seraphina tapped her drum softly, a heartbeat rhythm. Gabriel lifted his flute and played a melody that wove between the harp and the drum. The music was simple, repetitive, inviting. Adam listened, his heart matching the beat. He hummed along, then sang a vowel sound. Haniel smiled and nodded. The song grew, voices joining one by one—soft humming, then full words. The lyrics were simple: “Walk with us. Work with us. Trust with us. Rest with us.” The words repeated. Each repetition felt like a step, like a seed pressed into soil, like a breath inhaled and exhaled. The Bright One’s lips moved, forming the words silently. His eyes were closed. He was listening. Perhaps he was remembering when he had led songs that did not twist.

When the song ended, they sat in silence. The fire popped. Stars emerged. Asteriel pointed out constellations slowly, his voice low. “That one is the Shepherd’s Staff,” he said, pointing. “It reminds us of guidance. This one is the River’s Bend. It reminds us that even in the sky, boundaries shape beauty.” Adam listened, tracing the patterns with his eyes. He felt small and grounded at the same time. He felt full and hungry. He felt joy and weight. He felt alive.

God placed a blanket woven from soft fibres over Adam’s shoulders. “Rest now,” He whispered. “Tomorrow, we will work together.” Adam curled up near the fire. He listened to the murmurs of angels. He felt the gaze of God. He glanced once toward the willow where the Bright One sat again, his face shadowed. Adam raised his hand and waved. The Bright One hesitated, then lifted his hand in return. Adam smiled and closed his eyes. Sleep came quickly.

The night held them all, those who trusted without question, those who trusted with questions, and those who questioned without trust. Eden breathed as one; the law hummed beneath; boundaries held; breath continued. No exile had yet occurred. The valley was full of possibility.
