Chapter 17 — Clothing of Mercy

The day after the judgments dawned heavy and soft. Dew clung to the blades of grass and to the thorns that had emerged overnight. Everything looked the same, but nothing felt the same. Adam and Eve slept fitfully beside the ashes of their fire, arms tangled, their handmade fig–leaf coverings itchy and fragile. God stood a short distance away, watching them with tenderness. The angels maintained their vigil in a wide circle, eyes darting between the sleeping humans and the new growth of sharpness at their feet. Even the Bright One and his companions lingered on the hillside, curiosity pinning them despite their pride. They, like everyone else, felt the weight of what had transpired and the uncertainty of what would come.

A New Commission

As light filtered through the upper branches of the almond tree, God spoke quietly. “Adam, Eve,” He said. The names carried the same warmth as when He had first breathed them, even if the air was now thick with rue. They stirred, blinking sleep from their eyes, hearts quickening when they recognised His voice. Their bodies were stiff; their fig leaves had shifted in the night. They drew them closer instinctively, embarrassed once again by their nakedness.

“Come,” God invited. “Walk with Me.” His tone held no condemnation, only gravity and compassion. They rose and walked to Him. The ground felt different under their bare feet—some patches soft with dew, others pricked by small, thorny shoots. Eve gasped when a thorn pierced the arch of her foot. Adam reached down, pulled it out, and a small bead of blood welled up. They stared at the droplet, mesmerised and frightened. They had never seen their own blood before. It glistened ruby in the morning light.

God knelt to their level and gently took Adam’s foot in His hands. “This,” He said, touching the bead of blood, “is life flowing inside you. It hurts to spill it. One day, blood will be spilled on purpose to heal. Today, you will see the first spilling.”

Adam and Eve exchanged wide–eyed glances. “Why?” Eve asked, her voice husky with sleep and fear. “We are sorry. We promised we would listen. Why must there be more?”

“Mercy requires cost,” God said. “Covering requires sacrifice. You attempted to cover yourselves with leaves that wither and itch. I will provide a covering that protects and honours your bodies until the day you are clothed differently.” His eyes were tender but unyielding. “You will witness the cost, so you may understand the seriousness of your choice and the depth of My love.”

He looked up at the circle of angels. “Kothriel,” He called. “Come.” A figure stepped forward—a tall angel with skin the colour of raw linen and hair like braided flax. His wings shimmered like woven fibres. He carried a loom across his shoulders and threads looped around his arms. The scent of wool and fresh water followed him. Kothriel bowed. “I am here,” he said.

“Today you will fulfil a new role,” God told him. “You will learn to cut and stitch. You will make garments of skin to cover Adam and Eve. This is a mercy. Teach them how to honour their bodies. Teach them that covering is not hiding from Me, but protecting intimacy.”

Kothriel’s face tightened. He had woven robes of light for angels, tapestries of stars for the heavens, but he had never imagined sewing animal skins. “What skins shall I use?” he asked quietly.

God turned toward the meadow where animals grazed. There, among the lambs, was one that had followed Adam around the garden in the days before the act. It was pure white, its fleece unblemished, its eyes trusting. Adam recognised it immediately and felt a pang. “Little one,” he whispered under his breath. The lamb looked up at God and trotted forward, unafraid.

“Why this one?” Eve asked, her hands trembling. “It trusts us.”

“Precisely,” God said. “Love gives willingly. Trust reveals the cost. Mercy is born from love that suffers.” His gaze never left the lamb. He extended His hand and the lamb came to Him. God placed His other hand on the animal’s head. “Close your eyes,” He instructed Adam and Eve gently. “You do not need to see the act to understand the weight, but you must feel the cost.”

They closed their eyes. The watchers inhaled sharply, pens hovering. Never had death occurred in the garden. The sound was small but devastating—a soft bleat cut short. Adam flinched. Eve let out a choked sob. Muriel covered her mouth with her hand. Longiel clutched her jar of desires. Remiel’s quill trembled. The Bright One’s expression flickered—something like shock, then a smirk he suppressed. Gadreel grinned; Penemue looked ill; Samyaza closed his eyes and whispered, “Forgive us.”

The scent of iron filled the air. When Adam and Eve opened their eyes, they saw blood pooled on the grass where the lamb had stood. The white fleece was now darkened where the life had left it. God lifted the lamb’s lifeless body with utmost tenderness, as if cradling a child. His hands were stained red. For a moment, a silent lament vibrated through heaven. Haniel’s harp string snapped of its own accord. Asteriel pressed her hand to her chest. The sky seemed to dim.

Kothriel stepped forward, tears slipping down his cheeks. “I do not know how to do this,” he whispered. “I have only woven beauty, not cut into skin.”

“I will guide you,” God replied. He knelt beside Kothriel and set the lamb gently on a stone. He showed Kothriel how to remove the fleece without tearing the skin, how to cut along the belly, how to treat the leather with herbs so it would not rot. Adam and Eve watched, their faces pale. Blood dripped down the stone and into the soil. Small ants approached and drank. New life would soon feed on the spill. Remiel dipped his finger in the blood and pressed a dot on his vellum. First blood spilled, he wrote. Smells of iron and salt. Taste unknown. He then drew a tiny droplet icon with spikenard fragrance. “This shall be the blood drop symbol,” Saraqael announced, pressing a carved droplet stamp onto the page. He applied spikenard oil to it—the scent of burial and devotion.

As Kothriel worked, God spoke quietly to Adam and Eve. “This animal’s life is taken not because I delight in death,” He said, “but because covering requires cost. One day, there will be a covering that does not decay, prepared by My own hands from My own life. For now, this will remind you of the seriousness of turning away and the tenderness of My mercy.”

Adam nodded, tears streaming. Eve reached out tentatively and touched the lamb’s fleece. “It is soft,” she said, voice cracking. “Softer than leaves.”

“It will protect your skin from the thorns,” God said. “It will warm you in cold nights. It will remind you that what dies can cover and that mercy always has a cost.”

The Weaving of Mercy

Kothriel spread the fresh skins over his loom. He measured Adam and Eve with his hands, noting the breadth of their shoulders, the curve of their hips. He did not dwell on their shame; he saw only bodies fearfully and wonderfully made. He cut patterns that would drape rather than constrict, leaving room for movement and growth. He sewed with sinew that Remiel had prepared from the lamb’s ligaments, threading it with an ivory needle. Each stitch was a prayer: “May this garment remind you of love,” he whispered. “May it shield without hiding. May it be a sign of mercy.”

While Kothriel worked, Glossiel gathered Adam and Eve to teach them vocabulary. “This is called a needle,” he said, holding up the slender bone. “Needle,” Adam repeated, rolling the new sound in his mouth. “Needle.” Eve tried. Glossiel pointed to the thread. “Sinew,” he said. “Sinew,” Eve repeated. He pointed to the skin. “Leather,” he said. Adam frowned. “Is this the lamb?” he asked. Glossiel nodded. Adam gently stroked the material. He did not recoil, though sadness flickered in his eyes. Glossiel drew the word garment on a small board and said, “Garment.” Adam and Eve repeated. They learned words for “sew,” “stitch,” “cover,” “tunic.”

Around them, the angels prepared. Muriel and other healers crushed lavender and chamomile, mixing them with rendered fat to create a balm. “Rub this on the leather,” Muriel told Kothriel. “It will soften it and soothe their skin.” Naschiel brought sage and cedar to smoke gently under the skins, infusing them with a fragrance that would repel insects and evoke memory. Eariel listened to the sound of thread piercing leather—soft whispers—and memorised it to weave into future lullabies. Ophiel watched the patterns Kothriel made with his stitches and planned to teach Adam and Eve how patterns tell stories.

Saraqael and the watchers created new record symbols to mark the moment. They carved a tiny tunic shape, a small square with a vertical slit, to stamp onto pages whenever clothing symbolised mercy. They scented the tunic stamp with myrrh and cedar. They also created a new line—two parallel lines that converged at the end—to represent the joining of bodies and coverings, the blending of vulnerability and protection. Remiel wrote: New symbols: tunic stamp (mercy covering), convergence lines (vulnerability protected). Scent: myrrh, cedar. He pressed the tunic stamp beside his note and breathed in the fragrance.

Shomeriel, observing the process, felt the weight of the blood spilled and the mercy extended. He wrote: Covering requires cost. He stamped the broken circle and the new tunic stamp side by side. The juxtaposition made him ache—fracture and mercy, side by side.

Teaching the Use of Garments

When Kothriel finished sewing, he held up two simple tunics—one for Adam, one for Eve. They were cut from the same skin, but each had its own shape. Adam’s was wider at the shoulders, leaving room for his broad chest; Eve’s flowed more around the hips and allowed ease for movement. Both were sleeveless, tied at the shoulders with leather strips. They were soft to the touch, heavy with meaning, infused with scents of cedar, myrrh, and lavender. Kothriel approached Adam first. “I will show you how to wear this,” he said. Adam nodded, eyes red but attentive.

Kothriel lifted the tunic over Adam’s head and guided his arms through. Adam flinched as the leather brushed his sunburned shoulders. Then he relaxed as it settled, hugging his body. He felt the coolness of the cured skin and the slight weight pressing down. “It is… comforting,” he said, surprised. “It does not itch.”

“It will protect you,” Kothriel said. “But remember, this is mercy. It does not make you righteous. You will feel heat and cold. You will feel joy and sorrow. This garment is a sign that you are loved even when you fail.”

Eve’s turn came next. Kothriel lifted the second tunic over her. As the leather touched her skin, she gasped. Not in discomfort, but in recognition. “It feels like the lamb,” she whispered. “I feel as if it is still alive.”

Kothriel smiled sadly. “In a way, its life now covers yours.” He tied the leather strips on her shoulders and stepped back. “You are clothed.” The words resonated in the valley. For the first time since the act, Adam and Eve stood before God without a fig–leaf barrier. Their bodies were covered, but their eyes met God’s without flinching. There was shame still, but it shifted slightly to humility.

“Thank you,” Adam said, voice breaking. “Thank you for loving us even now.” Eve nodded, tears in her eyes. “Thank You,” she echoed. They did not know how else to express the mixture of gratitude, grief, and awe swirling within them.

God smiled—an expression of deep sorrow and deep love combined. “These garments are the first of many acts of mercy,” He said. “They will remind you that even when you break trust, I move toward you. Wear them as reminders to seek Me, to confess quickly, to forgive readily. Teach your children to honour their bodies, not to hide them from Me. My gaze sees beyond coverings and skin; My love reaches deeper than shame.”

He continued, “There will come a day when clothing will be a mark of culture and creativity. You will weave patterns and colours. You will use wool, flax, silk, and fur. Clothing will become language. But remember this: the first garments were mercy, not vanity. They were made from sacrifice, not status. Do not let your coverings become walls between you and others.”

Adam and Eve nodded, absorbing His words. They touched the leather gently. The scent of cedar and myrrh calmed them. They breathed deeply, letting the aroma become part of their memory.

The Healers’ Council

As Adam and Eve tried walking in their new garments, the healers gathered to discuss their expanded roles. Muriel, Sofiel, Kisleviel, and Haemiel convened beneath a willow tree by the river. The leaves whispered above them, the river murmured at their feet. “Pain and death have entered,” Muriel said softly, her voice carrying the weight of new reality. “We must learn to bind wounds of flesh as well as spirit. We must teach them to treat their own injuries and the injuries of animals. We must know herbs for infection, for swelling, for fever.”

Haemiel, his hands still stained faintly with the lamb’s blood, spoke with reverence. “Blood has spilled,” he said. “We will need to teach them that blood is sacred and not to waste it. We will need to learn to stop bleeding, to cleanse wounds, to draw out venom when serpents bite.”

Kisleviel added, “Shame will accompany injury. We must help them distinguish between physical harm and moral wrong. A cut is not a sin. Blood spilled while building is not guilt. We must teach them to care for each other without judgement.”

Sofiel nodded. “Childbirth will now include pain. We must learn to comfort and guide women through it. We must discern when to intervene and when to wait. We must not remove pain entirely, for pain teaches, but we must ensure safety.” She looked at the lamb’s hide wrapped around her waist and inhaled its scent. “We will need to teach them how to use skins to wrap infants, how to swaddle with love.”

Muriel proposed that they begin experiments. “We will bruise herbs, mix them with water and oil, and test them on small scratches,” she said. “We will observe the responses. We will ask God for wisdom. We will prepare oils to anoint and teas to drink. We will teach them to pray while they heal, so their hearts and bodies mend together.”

The healers agreed. They drew diagrams of human muscles and bones in the sand, referencing what Haemiel had shown them on the day of formation. They collected comfrey, plantain, calendula, and yarrow. They discussed future midwifery and hospice. Remiel recorded their plans, stamping the tunic symbol next to each line to indicate that healing was an extension of mercy.

Muriel lingered after the others began to disperse. “There is another kind of wound that we must learn to tend,” she said to Kisleviel. “A wound that bleeds invisible, that festers with silence. Shame cuts deeper than any thorn.”

Kisleviel nodded, his hands moving instinctively to the cloth wrapped around his shoulders. “I feel it in my chest when they hide,” he replied. “It is like a bruise that spreads.” He bent down and plucked a small sprig of hyssop from near the river. “Hyssop cleanses,” he said. “Honey soothes. Perhaps we can make a balm for confession—a balm that they apply when they speak the truth, not to cover the wound, but to mark its cleansing.”

Muriel’s eyes lit up. “A balm for shame,” she murmured. “Scented with hyssop and honey. When they confess, they will rub a bit on their wrists as a tangible reminder that shame is being lifted.” She imagined Adam and Eve dipping their fingers into a small jar, smelling the mix of sharp and sweet, feeling it on their skin as they spoke hard words. “It will teach them that confession is both bitter and sweet,” she added.

Haemiel overheard and added, “We will also need a balm for guilt—a thicker ointment made from myrrh and olive oil. When they make restitution, when they right a wrong, they will anoint each other with it. The scent will linger and remind them that repair is possible.”

Remiel wrote quickly: New balms: shame balm (hyssop + honey), guilt balm (myrrh + olive). Use with confession and restitution. Scent to teach the heart. He stamped a small jar symbol next to the line and scented the page with hyssop water.

Kisleviel closed his eyes and prayed, “May every confession be followed by balm. May no one carry unseen wounds alone.”

Guardians and Thorns

Meanwhile, the guardians gathered with Michael and Rahab to strategise. The appearance of thorns and thistles meant that their guarding would extend to physical protection as well as moral boundaries. They walked through the garden, noting where thorn bushes had sprouted overnight. Some were small and soft, their tips just emerging. Others already had sharp spines that could draw blood. Rahab reached out and deliberately pricked his finger. He watched a bead of red form and then wiped it onto the grass. “We must teach them to move carefully,” he said. “Pain will warn them of danger. We cannot shield them from every prick, but we can show them safer paths.”

Michael nodded. “We will mark safe routes with stones or braided grasses,” he proposed. “We will practise walking barefoot through thorn patches so we understand what they will endure. We will learn when to intervene and when to let them experience minor pain to prevent greater harm.”

Domiel suggested that they plant certain flowers near thorns to attract bees and butterflies, making the dangerous areas also places of beauty and pollination. “Boundaries can be beautiful,” he said. “They do not have to be ugly walls.”

Peliel, guardian of rivers, reminded them, “Water will continue to be both boundary and blessing. Floods and droughts will come. After pain, they will need relief. We must be ready to guide them to safe pools and away from rushing currents.”

Rivqiel proposed practising carrying small bundles while navigating the thorns. “They will carry children and food,” she said. “We must learn how to shield those we carry without dulling their sensitivity to warnings.”

They concluded their council by pressing the new thorn stamp and the tunic stamp onto a sheet of vellum. “Guarding now includes leading them in mercy,” Michael wrote. “We will guard their steps, their bodies, their hearts.” He scented the page with pine and iron.

A Lament in Song

As afternoon faded into evening, Haniel gathered a group of angels and humans for a song of lament and mercy. He brought his harp, now restrung with new chords. Seraphina carried her lyre; Araziel held drum circles; Longiel brought her jar filled with swirling desires. Muriel held a small bowl of oil; Kisleviel brought a pouch of ash. Adam and Eve, wearing their new garments, joined the circle nervously.

“This song will hold both sorrow and kindness,” Haniel announced. “We will lament the cost of mercy and celebrate that mercy exists. We will name the lamb, so its life is not forgotten. We will ask for strength to bear pain without hardening.”

He began to play a slow melody in a minor key. The notes were low and full, like a river moving through a canyon. Seraphina layered in a higher line, like wind through leaves. Araziel struck the drum gently, mimicking a heartbeat. Haniel sang the first verse:

We walked away, we broke the thread,
We hid our shame in leaves of dread;
A lamb came near with trust in eyes,
And mercy met our fear with cries.

Adam listened, tears welling. Eve’s hands tightened around her tunic. They were both grateful that the lamb’s story was being sung, that its death was being honoured. Muriel stepped forward during the chorus and poured oil into ash, making a paste. She anointed Adam’s forehead and Eve’s hands with the mixture. “This is ash,” she whispered, “reminding you that you will return to dust. This is oil, reminding you that mercy soothes. Wear both and remember.”

Longiel opened her jar and allowed a soft glow to emerge—a shimmering golden mist that represented the desire for redemption. It drifted over the circle like incense. “Hold on to this,” she murmured. “Even when you feel the weight of judgement, desire redemption.”

Haniel continued the song, moving from lament to hope:

In pain we bear and in toil we sow,
Through thorns and sweat new life will grow;
A promise whispered through a seed,
A day will come when love is freed.

The song ended with a gentle hum, a humming that resonated with Chroniel’s threads, with Nefeshiel’s hum. Adam and Eve joined in the humming. It vibrated in their chests, reminding them of the breath that still filled them, the life that still pulsed. The watchers added humming lines in their records—wavering lines with small hum symbols—to show how song had become lament and blessing. Saraqael pressed the lament drop stamp and the tunic stamp next to each note.

Dream of Covering and Coming Exile

That night, sleep came more quickly to Adam and Eve. Their bodies were exhausted, their minds tired from tears and learning. Their dreams were vivid. Adam dreamed of walking under a heavy cloak, his shoulders draped with a garment that shone like the sun. Each step he took, thorns turned to blossoms beneath his feet. He looked up and saw a figure clothed in light ahead of him, beckoning him forward. The figure radiated warmth and safety. Adam did not see His face clearly, but he knew it was the Maker. The figure’s garment had scars on it. “Follow Me,” the figure said. “My burden is light.”

Eve dreamed of weaving in a tent with Kothriel. She and many women sat around a fire, their hands moving rhythmically, their laughter soft. They wove tunics of various colours and sizes. Outside, children ran and sang. Men and women brought wool and flax, telling stories as they worked. In the dream, she felt contentment and purpose. But she also sensed a sadness lingering at the edges—an awareness that they were far from the garden. She woke with tears, a longing in her chest for something she could not name yet.

Shomeriel recorded fragments of their dreams in the margins of his book, drawing a cloak and a tent. He pressed the dream flute symbol and noted: Dreams hint at future coverings and journeys. There is both purpose and sorrow. He did not yet know when these dreams would unfold, but he sensed they mattered.

The Bright One’s Reflection

Away from the circle, on a shadowed hill, the Bright One sat with Gadreel, Penemue, and Samyaza. He had watched the lamb’s death and the making of garments with a mixture of disgust and fascination. “He kills an animal,” he scoffed, “and they thank Him. He wounds them, and they bow. Is this not manipulation?”

Penemue swallowed hard. “He told them the consequences would come,” he said quietly. “He did not hide it. He also provided covering. I… felt something when they asked for forgiveness and when He answered. It felt… right.”

Gadreel rolled his eyes. “Of course you did,” he muttered. “You are becoming soft.” He turned to the Bright One. “What is our strategy now? We cannot rely on fruit alone. They will fear us. They know our voice.”

The Bright One stared at his reflection in a pool of water. It was distorted by ripples, making him appear twisted. He frowned. “We will not give up,” he said. “Pain breeds resentment. Labour breeds frustration. Shame breeds anger. We will amplify those feelings. We will tell them the covering is proof of His cruelty. We will suggest that the cost was too high. We will turn mercy into indictment.”

Samyaza hesitated. “He said another covering would come,” he murmured. “A covering from His own life. If that is true…” His voice trailed off. He did not know how to finish the thought. He felt something shifting in his heart. Gadreel snorted. “If it is true, then He will suffer. Let Him. Let His mercy cost Him. We will still rule.”

Penemue looked down. He thought of the tear he had shed when the lamb died. He thought of the forgiveness he had seen. He prayed silently, though he was not sure to whom: If You can forgive me, show me. If I can leave this path, make a way.

Shomeriel, listening from a distance with one ear, wrote: Plotting continues. Pain will be weaponised. Yet some hearts stir. Seeds of repentance may yet sprout. He pressed the tremor line and the hidden heart symbol. He prayed, “Remember Penemue.”

Preparing to Leave

The next morning, God gathered Adam and Eve again. The air felt different—more open, more solemn. “You will not remain in this garden,” He said gently. “There is a tree whose fruit you have eaten, and another tree whose fruit you must not eat now. If you eat of the tree of life in your current state, you would remain in this brokenness forever. I love you too much to let you be trapped in unending decay. You will leave this place, but My presence will go with you. We will talk about this soon.”

Adam and Eve’s eyes widened. “Leave?” Eve whispered. “Where will we go?”

“Beyond the boundary,” God replied. “There is a land rich and untended. You will work it. You will plant and harvest. You will raise children. You will build homes. This garden will remain as a memory and a promise. One day, access will be granted again in a different form.”

Adam’s breath hitched. “Will You still walk with us?” he asked, voice small.

“Always,” God answered firmly. “My voice will still call. My presence will still be near, though it may feel different. Boundaries will be set to protect you from living forever in brokenness. We will talk more before you go. For now, wear your garments. Learn their weight. Teach your hands new work. Love each other.”

He turned to the angels. “Guardians, prepare the boundary. Kothriel, begin teaching them how to mend garments. Healers, gather herbs for the journey. Watchers, record these preparations. Messengers, craft words to describe exile and hope. Artists, begin designing patterns for memory. We are not done.”

The angels moved like ripples across water. Some hearts rejoiced at having tasks; others grieved the impending separation. Asteriel looked up at the stars faintly visible in the morning light. She began to plan the “Flaming Boundary” constellation. Chroniel felt a new pulse in the threads of time—a quickening. Nefeshiel adjusted the hum. The story was accelerating toward exile.
