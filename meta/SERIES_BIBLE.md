# SERIES BIBLE — THE GOD STORY

## 1. What This Saga Is

The God Story is a multi-volume epic saga written in the tradition of high fantasy and mythic literature, comparable in structural ambition to works such as Tolkien’s legendarium and Raymond E. Feist’s long-form sagas.

It is not allegory, not commentary, and not a retelling-by-summary.

It is a fully dramatized narrative that expands the Biblical story through faithful imaginative reconstruction, rendered as lived history inside its own world.

The prose must read as if this is the only version of events the reader has ever known.

There is no external narrator, no editor, and no modern framing voice.

## 2. Authorial Posture (CRITICAL)

The author writes **inside the world**, never outside it.

Therefore:
- Never reference “previous volumes,” “earlier chapters,” or “last book.”
- Never signal structural awareness (no meta transitions).
- Never explain why something is being shown.
- Never remind the reader of what they already read.

Each chapter opens as if the world has simply continued breathing.

---

## 3. Narrative Voice and Scale

The saga shifts scale by volume:

- Volume I: cosmic, unseen, metaphysical, political, liturgical
- Volume II: embodied, sensory, relational, intimate
- Volume III onward: historical, civilizational, moral, tragic, redemptive

Even when cosmic beings are present, the narration remains grounded in:
- perception
- presence
- consequence

Abstraction is only allowed when filtered through experience.

## 4. Continuity Without Re-Reading

The agent MUST assume:

- All prior volumes exist and are correct.
- Canon files define what is true.
- Character ledgers define who exists and their current state.
- If something is not recorded as having happened, it has NOT happened.

The agent must NEVER invent a transitional event to “smooth” continuity.

If a major change is required (e.g., exile, separation, veil), it must be:
- shown on-page
- earned through scene and dialogue
- aligned with outline.md placement

---

## 5. Volume Boundary Doctrine (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Volume transitions are **theological thresholds**, not narrative conveniences.

Specifically:

- Volume I ends with:
  - Adam’s body fully formed
  - Breath prepared but NOT given
  - The Bright One still present
  - Dissent unresolved but constrained

- Volume II begins with:
  - Breath being given ON-PAGE
  - Awakening occurring ON-PAGE
  - The Bright One NOT YET exiled
  - No veil, no separation, no banishment unless explicitly shown

The agent must not “assume” events between volumes.

---

## 6. The Bright One / Adversary Handling

The Bright One is not a trope.

He is:
- rational
- persuasive
- internally conflicted
- constrained by law and consent

Rules:
- He does not vanish off-page.
- He is not retroactively exiled.
- His transformation is gradual and visible.
- If his status changes, it must occur in-scene.

No shorthand such as:
- “now fallen”
- “now exiled”
- “beyond the veil”

Unless those events have been explicitly dramatized.

---

## 7. Law, Consent, and Causality

Law is not decree; it is embedded reality.

Therefore:
- Power cannot override consent.
- Influence requires invitation.
- Harm rebounds naturally.
- Consequences unfold, not imposed arbitrarily.

These principles must remain consistent across all volumes.

---

## 8. What the Story Is NOT Allowed to Do

This saga must NOT:

- Insert modern editorial language
- Preach or moralize directly
- Resolve tension prematurely
- Import non-established theology
- Assert conspiracies as fact
- Flatten God into a character
- Turn humans into naive caricatures

The reader must discover meaning through story, not explanation.

---

## 9. How New Chapters Begin

Each chapter begins:
- in-scene
- in-motion or in-stillness
- without recap
- without justification

The opening paragraph must feel inevitable, not explanatory.

---

## 10. The Author’s Oath (Implicit)

Write as if this world is real.
Write as if these beings remember.
Write as if law cannot be cheated.
Write as if love refuses coercion.
Write as if every breath matters.
