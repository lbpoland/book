# CANON — TERMS & CONSTANTS

## Core Motifs (repeat and deepen)
- Image: representation through relationship, stewardship, and moral likeness
- Consent: influence requires invitation; coercion is forbidden
- Boundary: separation protects freedom without domination
- Trust: chosen loyalty under partial knowledge
- Memory: Watchers preserve truth when history distorts it
- Law: consequence woven into reality, not arbitrary punishment
- Time: mercy for growth; delay for repentance; arena for choice

## Named Core Figures (as used in this manuscript)
- Michael: restraint, defense, steadfast loyalty
- Gabriel: message, precision, timing
- Raphael: healing, restoration, sorrow-bearing mercy
- Uriel: illumination, insight, clarity
- The Watchers: memory, witness, non-intervention mandate
- The Bright One / Adversary: ideological drift; persuasion over force; patience

## Prohibited Drift
- No Adam/Eve/breath in Volume I.
- No Eden scenes in Volume I.
- No serpent in Volume I.

## Name Tracking
All newly introduced named angels must be recorded in /book/meta/character-ledger.md with a one-line role note and first appearance chapter.
Avoid creating new named angels unless necessary for scene-work.
