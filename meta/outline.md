---

## ACT V — THE EDGE OF BREATH (The Threshold)
18. The Council Before Dust
   - “Let Us make” as relational intention
   - image as stewardship and representation
19. Dust Shaped by Hand
   - God’s intimacy in forming the body
   - heaven’s awe; the adversary’s focus
20. The Silence Before Breath (VOLUME I END)
   - breath gathered, not given
   - law, consent, boundary, time all converge
   - end on a resonant stillness: the moment before awakening

---

## Notes
- Chapters 1–4 should be slow, majestic, intimate.
- Chapters 5–9 should be political-philosophical, emotionally tense, with multiple dialogue sequences.
- Chapters 10–13 must establish rules that never break later (consent/boundary).
- Chapters 14–17 are creation-as-liturgical epic, with sensory writing and cosmic scale.
- Chapters 18–20 are the culmination, ending before breath.
