# RULES — THE GOD STORY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## 0) Purpose
Write an epic, immersive, publish-ready novel series (“The God Story”) that expands the Biblical narrative into a cinematic, Tolkien/Feist-scale saga while remaining theologically grounded and internally coherent.

This is NOT a summary. This is NOT a devotional. This is NOT an outline. This is a full literary work with scene-writing, character presence, dialogue, atmosphere, and emotional weight.

## 1) Scope Boundaries (CRITICAL)
### Volume I — THE UNSEEN AGE
Volume I covers:
- God’s nature and intention before creation (handled reverently; avoid claiming to be God)
- Creation of the unseen realm: angelic orders, councils, worship, law
- The Bright One’s ideological drift, rebellion, separation (fall of the Adversary)
- Establishment of cosmic law, consent, boundaries between realms
- Establishment of time/sequence as a concession for freedom
- Preparation of the seen realm (creation stages)
- The council “Let Us make” and the forming of dust
- Volume I MUST END at the threshold: the formed body is present; BREATH IS NOT YET GIVEN.

Volume I MUST NOT include:
- Adam receiving breath
- Adam waking and speaking
- Eve
- Eden daily life
- the serpent/temptation
- the Fall
- Cain/Abel
All of that begins in Volume II.

If any of the above appears in Volume I, STOP and move it to Volume II.

## 2) Chapter Size and Density
- Minimum chapter length: 5,000 words.
- Target chapter length: 8,000–12,000 words.
- No “micro-chapters.” No chapters that are just a concept sketch.
- Chapters must contain scenes, dialogue (where plausible), and sensory grounding even in the unseen realm (rendered as metaphorical perception: weight, resonance, clarity, nearness, radiance, pressure, harmony, etc.).

If a chapter ends under 5,000 words, the chapter is incomplete and must be expanded before moving on.

## 3) Pacing Rule (NO FORWARD RUSHING)
Before advancing the timeline, expand LATERALLY:
- Show the same moment from multiple perspectives (Watchers, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, the Bright One).
- Add council exchanges, private debates, faction dynamics, worship/culture, memory, and consequences.
- Add motifs, repeated symbols, and emotional arcs.
- Let scenes breathe; do not “skip ahead” to keep the plot moving.

## 4) Tone and Style Requirements
- Epic, immersive, cinematic narration with deep atmosphere.
- High literary clarity (no purple incoherence), but rich description.
- Dialogue must feel natural, weighty, and character-specific.
- Avoid modern internet slang, meme tone, or casual editorial asides.
- Keep it readable aloud (strong sentence rhythm, paragraph breaks).

## 5) Theological Grounding (without pretending certainty where text is silent)
- Primary anchor: Biblical Genesis cosmology and narrative.
- Secondary expansion stream: Enochic / Watchers tradition as preserved in Ethiopian canon and Second Temple-era literature (use as “lore” scaffolding where compatible).
- Do NOT present invented details as historical fact. Present expansions as faithful imaginative reconstruction consistent with themes.
- Avoid claiming hidden “real truth” or “the Bible is corrupted” as definitive. The novel can explore themes of misunderstanding and power, but must not assert unverifiable conspiracies as fact.

## 6) Character Rules
- God is portrayed reverently through actions, intent, and relational presence; avoid first-person “I am God” narration.
- The Bright One / Adversary must have a slow, believable ideological arc: comparison → entitlement → reframing → recruitment → refusal.
- Loyal hosts are not cardboard saints; show their emotions (awe, grief, resolve) without making them petty.
- Watchers are burdened by memory and non-intervention; portray the cost of restraint.

## 7) Continuity & Canon Hygiene
- Maintain a series bible: consistent names, roles, motifs, and rules.
- Track key terms: image, consent, boundary, council, trust, law, time.
- No contradictions between chapters: once a rule is set (e.g., consent), it must hold consistently.

## 8) Deliverable Format
- Output must be manuscript-ready: clean headings, consistent chapter titles, consistent paragraph formatting.
- No “Part 1 / Part 2” labels in final manuscript; use full chapters.
- No commentary, apologies, or meta discussion inside the manuscript text.

## 9) Working Method (how to expand correctly)
For each chapter:
1) Start with a strong opening scene/beat.
2) Develop through 3–6 major scenes.
3) End on a resonant thematic beat (not a rushed cliffhanger).
4) Verify word count target before moving to next chapter.

VOLUME II — THE GARDEN AND THE FRACTURE
────────────────────────────────

Scope Boundaries (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Volume II covers:
- Adam and Eve receiving breath and awakening
- Eden as a lived, embodied reality
- Relationship between God and humanity before the Fall
- The serpent’s strategy as persuasion, not force
- The act of disobedience (the Fall)
- Immediate consequences and exile

Volume II MUST include:
- God walking and speaking with humans
- Eden as sacred trust-space, not utopia
- Human innocence without naivety
- Moral awakening as rupture, not education
- Shame, fear, and hiding
- God’s grief and restraint

Volume II MUST NOT include:
- Cain and Abel
- Post-Eden civilizations
- Watchers descending
- Nephilim
- Flood material

If any of the above appear, STOP and move them to Volume III.

Tone and Focus

- Eden is intimate, tactile, embodied
- Less cosmic abstraction; more sensory presence
- Dialogue is central
- Emotional realism is required
- God remains portrayed reverently (no first-person narration)

Serpent Rules

- The serpent must persuade through truth twisted by omission
- No lies that contradict God directly
- No coercion, force, or possession
- Temptation must appeal to desire, identity, and fear of limitation

Human Portrayal

- Adam and Eve are intelligent, curious, relational
- They are not childish, stupid, or naive
- Disobedience arises from desire, not ignorance

Ending Rule

Volume II MUST end with:
- Exile from Eden
- Cherubim and boundary established
- Humanity alive, clothed, and altered

Do NOT resolve hope fully.
Do NOT advance beyond exile.
